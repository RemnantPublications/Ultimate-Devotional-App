By the plan of\nredemption, however, a way has been opened whereby the inhabitants of\nthe earth may still have connection with heaven. God has communicated\nwith men by His Spirit, and divine light has been imparted to the world\nby revelations to His chosen servants. \"Holy men of God spake as they\nwere moved by the Holy Ghost.\" \u00a02 Peter 1:21. \u00a0{GC v.1}",

Those who had been taught of God, communicated\ntheir knowledge to others, and it was handed down from father to son,\nthrough successive generations. The preparation of the written word\nbegan in the time of Moses. Inspired revelations were then embodied in\nan inspired book.

The Infinite One by His Holy Spirit has shed light\ninto the minds and hearts of His servants.

When Christ should hang upon the cross of Calvary, Israel's\nday as a nation favored and blessed of God would be ended. The loss of\neven one soul is a calamity infinitely outweighing the gains and\ntreasures of a world; but as Christ looked upon Jerusalem, the doom of a\nwhole city, a whole nation, was before Him---that city, that nation,\nwhich had once been the chosen of God, His peculiar treasure. \u00a0{GC 20.3}",

In their fury\nthe soldiers hurled blazing brands into the chambers adjoining the\ntemple, and then with their swords they slaughtered in great numbers\nthose who had found shelter there. Blood flowed down the temple steps\nlike water. Thousands upon thousands of Jews perished. Above the sound\nof battle, voices were heard shouting: \"Ichabod!\"---the glory is\ndeparted. \u00a0{GC 33.1}",

The centurion Liberalis endeavored to force obedience\nwith his staff of office; but even respect for the emperor gave way to\nthe furious animosity against the Jews, to the fierce excitement of\nbattle, and to the insatiable hope of plunder. The soldiers saw\neverything around them radiant with gold, which shone dazzlingly in the\nwild light of the flames; they supposed that incalculable treasures were\nlaid up in the sanctuary. A soldier, unperceived, thrust a lighted torch\nbetween the hinges of the door: the whole building was in flames in an\ninstant. The blinding smoke and fire forced the officers to retreat, and\nthe noble edifice was left to its fate. \u00a0{GC 33.2}",

The roofs of cedar were\nlike sheets of flame; the gilded pinnacles shone like spikes of red\nlight; the gate towers sent up tall columns of flame and smoke. The\nneighboring hills were lighted up; and dark groups of people were seen\nwatching in horrible anxiety the progress of the destruction: the walls\nand heights of the upper city were crowded with faces, some pale with\nthe agony of despair, others scowling unavailing vengeance. The shouts\nof the Roman soldiery as they ran to and fro, and the howlings of the\ninsurgents who were perishing in the flames, mingled with the roaring of\nthe conflagration and the thundering sound of falling timbers. The\nechoes of the mountains replied or brought back the shrieks of the\npeople on the heights; all along the walls resounded screams and\nwailings; men who were expiring with famine rallied their remaining\nstrength to utter a cry of anguish and desolation. \u00a0{GC 34.1}",

Both the city and the temple were razed to their\nfoundations, and the ground upon which the holy house had stood was\n\"plowed like a field.\" \u00a0Jeremiah 26:18. In the siege and the slaughter\nthat followed, more than a million of the people perished; the survivors\nwere carried away as captives, sold as slaves, dragged to Rome to grace\nthe conqueror's triumph, thrown to wild beasts in the amphitheaters, or\nscattered as homeless wanderers throughout the earth. \u00a0{GC 35.2}",

It is thus that the great deceiver seeks to conceal his own work.\nBy stubborn rejection of divine love and mercy, the Jews had caused the\nprotection of God to be withdrawn from them, and Satan was permitted to\nrule them according to his will.

But when men pass the limits of divine forbearance, that\nrestraint is removed. God does not stand toward the sinner as an\nexecutioner of the sentence against transgression; but He leaves the\nrejectors of His mercy to themselves, to reap that which they have sown.\nEvery ray of light rejected, every warning despised or unheeded, every\npassion indulged, every transgression of the law of God, is a seed sown\nwhich yields its unfailing harvest. The Spirit of God, persistently\nresisted, is at last withdrawn from the sinner, and then there is left\nno power to control the evil passions of the soul, and no protection\nfrom the malice and enmity of Satan. The destruction of Jerusalem is a\nfearful and solemn warning to all who are trifling with the offers of\ndivine grace and resisting the pleadings of divine mercy.

As they\nbecame the objects of popular hatred and suspicion, informers stood\nready, for the sake of gain, to betray the innocent. They were condemned\nas rebels against the empire, as foes of religion, and pests to society.\nGreat numbers were thrown to wild beasts or burned alive in the\namphitheaters. Some were crucified; others were covered with the skins\nof wild animals and thrust into the arena to be torn by dogs. Their\npunishment was often made the chief entertainment at public fetes.

Even in her\nbest estate the church was not composed wholly of the true, pure, and\nsincere. Our Saviour taught that those who willfully indulge in sin are\nnot to be received into the church; yet He connected with Himself men\nwho were faulty in character, and granted them the benefits of His\nteachings and example, that they might have an opportunity to see their\nerrors and correct them. Among the twelve apostles was a traitor. Judas\nwas accepted, not \u00a0because of his defects of character, but\nnotwithstanding them. He was connected with the disciples, that, through\nthe instruction and example of Christ, he might learn what constitutes\nChristian character, and thus be led to see his errors, to repent, and,\nby the aid of divine grace, to purify his soul \"in obeying the truth.\"\nBut Judas did not walk in the light so graciously permitted to shine\nupon him. By indulgence in sin he invited the temptations of Satan. His\nevil traits of character became predominant. He yielded his mind to the\ncontrol of the powers of darkness, he became angry when his faults were\nreproved, and thus he was led to commit the fearful crime of betraying\nhis Master. So do all who cherish evil under a profession of godliness\nhate those who disturb their peace by condemning their course of sin.\nWhen a favorable opportunity is presented, they will, like Judas, betray\nthose who for their good have sought to reprove them. \u00a0{GC 43.2}",

Ananias and Sapphira acted\nthe part of deceivers, pretending to make an entire sacrifice for God,\nwhen they were covetously withholding a portion for themselves. The\nSpirit of truth revealed to the apostles the real character of these\npretenders, and the judgments of God rid the church of this foul blot\nupon its purity. This signal evidence of the discerning Spirit of Christ\nin the church was a terror to hypocrites and evildoers. They could not\nlong remain in connection with those who were, in habit and disposition,\nconstant representatives of Christ; and as trials and persecution came\nupon His followers, those only who were willing to forsake all for the\ntruth's sake desired to become His disciples.

Satan exulted that he had succeeded in deceiving so\nlarge a number of the followers of Christ. He then brought his power to\nbear more fully upon these, and inspired them to persecute those who\nremained true to God. None understood so well how to oppose the true\nChristian faith as did those who had once been its defenders; and these\napostate Christians, uniting with their half-pagan companions, directed\ntheir warfare against the most essential features of the doctrines of\nChrist. \u00a0{GC 45.1}",

To secure peace and\nunity they were ready to make any concession consistent with fidelity to\nGod; but they felt that even peace would be too dearly purchased at the\nsacrifice of principle.

Therefore they were hated by the\nwicked, even as Abel was hated by the ungodly Cain. For the same reason\nthat Cain slew Abel, did those who sought to throw off the restraint of\nthe Holy Spirit, put to death God's people. It was for the same reason\nthat the Jews rejected and crucified the Saviour---because the purity\nand holiness of His character was a constant rebuke to their selfishness\nand corruption.

The only reason is that the church has conformed to the\nworld's standard and therefore awakens no opposition. The religion which\nis current in our day is not of the pure and holy character that marked\nthe Christian faith in the days of Christ and His apostles.

The spirit of compromise and conformity was restrained\nfor a time by the fierce persecutions which the church endured under\npaganism. But as persecution ceased, and Christianity entered the courts\nand palaces of kings, she laid aside the humble simplicity of Christ and\nHis apostles for the pomp and pride of pagan priests and rulers; and in\nplace of the requirements of God, she substituted human theories and\ntraditions. The nominal conversion of Constantine, \u00a0in the early part of\nthe fourth century, caused great rejoicing; and the world, cloaked with\na form of righteousness, walked into the church. Now the work of\ncorruption rapidly progressed. Paganism, while appearing to be\nvanquished, became the conqueror. Her spirit controlled the church. Her\ndoctrines, ceremonies, and superstitions were incorporated into the\nfaith and worship of the professed followers of Christ. \u00a0{GC 49.2}",

He came to the\nSon of God in the wilderness of temptation, and showing Him all the\nkingdoms of the world and the glory of them, offered to give all into\nHis hands if He would but acknowledge the supremacy of the prince of\ndarkness. Christ rebuked the presumptuous tempter and forced him to\ndepart. But Satan meets with greater success in presenting the same\ntemptations to man. To secure worldly gains and honors, the church was\nled to seek the favor and support of the great men of earth; and having\nthus rejected Christ, she was induced to yield allegiance to the\nrepresentative of Satan---the bishop of Rome. \u00a0{GC 50.2}",

It was by the word that even the\nSaviour of the world had resisted his attacks. At every assault, Christ\npresented the shield of eternal truth, saying, \"It is written.\" To every\nsuggestion of the adversary, He opposed the wisdom and power of the\nword. In order for Satan to maintain his sway over men, and establish\nthe authority of the papal usurper, he must keep them in ignorance of\nthe Scriptures. The Bible would exalt God and place finite men in their\ntrue position; therefore its sacred truths must be concealed and\nsuppressed. This logic was adopted by the Roman Church. For hundreds of\nyears the circulation of the Bible was prohibited. The people were\nforbidden to read it or to have it in their houses, and unprincipled\npriests and prelates interpreted its teachings to sustain their\npretensions.

This \u00a0work it was not slow to attempt. To\nafford converts from heathenism a substitute for the worship of idols,\nand thus to promote their nominal acceptance of Christianity, the\nadoration of images and relics was gradually introduced into the\nChristian worship. The decree of a general council (see \u00a0Appendix)\nfinally established this system of idolatry. To complete the\nsacrilegious work, Rome presumed to expunge from the law of God the\nsecond commandment, forbidding image worship, and to divide the tenth\ncommandment, in order to preserve the number. \u00a0{GC 51.4}",
                "The spirit of concession to paganism opened the way for a still further\ndisregard of Heaven's authority.

In the first centuries the true\nSabbath had been kept by all Christians. They were jealous for the honor\nof God, and, believing that His law is immutable, they zealously guarded\nthe sacredness of its precepts. But with great subtlety Satan worked\nthrough his agents to bring about his object. That the attention of the\npeople might be called to the Sunday, it was made a festival in honor of\nthe resurrection of Christ. Religious services were held upon it; yet it\nwas regarded as a day of recreation, the Sabbath being still sacredly\nobserved. \u00a0{GC 52.1}",
                "To prepare the way for the work which he designed to accomplish, Satan\nhad led the Jews, before the advent of Christ, to load down the Sabbath\nwith the most rigorous exactions, making its observance a burden. Now,\ntaking advantage of the false light in which he had thus caused it to be\nregarded, he cast contempt upon it as a Jewish institution. While\nChristians generally continued to observe the Sunday as a joyous\nfestival, he led them, in order to show \u00a0their hatred of Judaism, to make\nthe Sabbath a fast, a day of sadness and gloom. \u00a0{GC 52.2}",

The day of the sun was reverenced by his pagan subjects\nand was honored by Christians; it was the emperor's policy to unite the\nconflicting interests of heathenism and Christianity. He was urged to do\nthis by the bishops of the church, who, inspired by ambition and thirst\nfor power, perceived that if the same day was observed by both\nChristians and heathen, it would promote the nominal acceptance of\nChristianity by pagans and thus advance the power and glory of the\nchurch. But while many God-fearing Christians were gradually led to\nregard Sunday as possessing a degree of sacredness, they still held the\ntrue Sabbath as the holy of the Lord and observed it in obedience to the\nfourth commandment. \u00a0{GC 53.1}",

Through half-converted pagans, ambitious prelates, and\nworld-loving churchmen he accomplished his purpose. Vast councils were\nheld from time to time, in which the dignitaries of the church were\nconvened from all the world. In nearly every council the Sabbath which\nGod had instituted was pressed down a little lower, while the Sunday was\ncorrespondingly exalted. Thus the pagan festival came finally to be\nhonored as a divine institution, while the Bible Sabbath was pronounced\na relic of Judaism, and its observers were declared to be accursed. \u00a0{GC\n53.2}",

In the fourth commandment, God\nis \u00a0revealed as the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and is thereby\ndistinguished from all false gods. It was as a memorial of the work of\ncreation that the seventh day was sanctified as a rest day for man. It\nwas designed to keep the living God ever before the minds of men as the\nsource of being and the object of reverence and worship. Satan strives\nto turn men from their allegiance to God, and from rendering obedience\nto His law; therefore he directs his efforts especially against that\ncommandment which points to God as the Creator. \u00a0{GC 53.3}",
                "Protestants now urge that the resurrection of Christ on Sunday made it\nthe Christian Sabbath. But Scripture evidence is lacking. No such honor\nwas given to the day by Christ or His apostles. The observance of Sunday\nas a Christian institution had its origin in that \"mystery of\nlawlessness\" (2 Thessalonians 2:7, R.V.) which, even in Paul's day, had\nbegun its work. Where and when did the Lord adopt this child of the\npapacy? What valid reason can be given for a change which the Scriptures\ndo not sanction? \u00a0{GC 54.1}",
                "In the sixth century the papacy had become firmly established. Its seat\nof power was fixed in the imperial city, and the bishop of Rome was\ndeclared to be the head over the entire church. Paganism had given place\nto the papacy. The dragon had given to the beast \"his power, and his\nseat, and great authority.\" \u00a0Revelation 13:2. And now began the 1260\nyears of papal oppression foretold in the prophecies of Daniel and the\nRevelation. \u00a0Daniel 7:25; \u00a0Revelation 13:5-7. (See \u00a0Appendix.) Christians\nwere forced to choose either to yield their integrity and accept the\npapal ceremonies and worship, or to wear away their lives in dungeons or\nsuffer death by the rack, the fagot, or the headsman's ax. Now were\nfulfilled the words of Jesus: \"Ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and\nbrethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause\nto be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men for My name's\nsake.\" \u00a0Luke 21:16, 17. Persecution opened upon the faithful with greater\nfury than ever before, \u00a0and the world became a vast battlefield. For\nhundreds of years the church of Christ found refuge in seclusion and\nobscurity. Thus says the prophet: \"The woman fled into the wilderness,\nwhere she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there\na thousand two hundred and three-score days.\" \u00a0Revelation 12:6. \u00a0{GC 54.2}",
                "The accession of the Roman Church to power marked the beginning of the\nDark Ages. As her power increased, the darkness deepened. Faith was\ntransferred from Christ, the true foundation, to the pope of Rome.\nInstead of trusting in the Son of God for forgiveness of sins and for\neternal salvation, the people looked to the pope, and to the priests and\nprelates to whom he delegated authority. They were taught that the pope\nwas their earthly mediator and that none could approach God except\nthrough him; and, further, that he stood in the place of God to them and\nwas therefore to be implicitly obeyed. A deviation from his requirements\nwas sufficient cause for the severest punishment to be visited upon the\nbodies and souls of the offenders. Thus the minds of the people were\nturned away from God to fallible, erring, and cruel men, nay, more, to\nthe prince of darkness himself, who exercised his power through them.\nSin was disguised in a garb of sanctity. When the Scriptures are\nsuppressed, and man comes to regard himself as supreme, we need look\nonly for fraud, deception, and debasing iniquity.

To establish this claim, some means must be\nemployed to give it a show of authority; and this was readily suggested\nby the father of lies. Ancient writings were forged by monks.

As the work progressed, the papal leaders and their converts\nencountered the primitive Christians. A striking contrast was presented.\nThe latter were simple, humble, and Scriptural in character, doctrine,\nand manners, while the former manifested the superstition, pomp, and\narrogance of popery. The emissary of Rome demanded that these Christian\nchurches acknowledge the supremacy of the sovereign pontiff. The Britons\nmeekly replied that they desired to love all men, but that the pope was\nnot entitled to supremacy in the church, and they could render to him\nonly that submission which was due to every follower of Christ. Repeated\nattempts were made to secure their allegiance to Rome; but these humble\nChristians, amazed at the pride displayed by her emissaries, steadfastly\nreplied that they knew no other master than Christ. Now the true spirit\nof the papacy was revealed. Said the Romish leader: \"If you will not\nreceive brethren who bring you peace, you shall receive enemies who will\nbring you war.

                "The very existence of this people, holding the faith of the ancient\nchurch, was a constant testimony to Rome's apostasy, and therefore\nexcited the most bitter hatred and persecution. Their refusal to\nsurrender the Scriptures was also an offense that Rome could not\ntolerate. She determined to blot them from the earth. Now began the most\nterrible crusades against God's people in their mountain homes.\nInquisitors were put upon their track, and the scene of innocent Abel\nfalling before the murderous Cain was often repeated. \u00a0{GC 76.2}",

They were not accused as idlers, or\ndishonest, or disorderly; but it was declared that they had an\nappearance of piety and sanctity that seduced \"the sheep of the true\nfold.\" Therefore the pope ordered \"that malicious and abominable sect of\nmalignants,\" if they \"refuse to abjure, to be crushed like venomous\nsnakes.\"---Wylie, b. 16, ch. 1. Did this haughty potentate expect to\nmeet those words again?

It annulled all contracts made in\nfavor of Vaudois, ordered their domestics to abandon them, forbade all\npersons to give them any aid whatever, and empowered all persons to take\npossession of their property.\"---Wylie, b. 16, ch. 1.

The\nmost horrible tragedies were enacted. Corrupt and blasphemous priests\nand popes were doing the work which Satan appointed them. Mercy had \u00a0no\nplace in their natures.

Its truths were not to be forever hidden. He could as easily\nunchain the words of life as He could open prison doors and unbolt iron\ngates to set His servants free. In the different countries of Europe men\nwere moved by the Spirit of God to search for the truth as for hid\ntreasures. Providentially guided to the Holy Scriptures, they studied\nthe sacred pages with intense interest. They were willing to accept the\nlight at any cost to themselves. Though they did not see all things\nclearly, they were enabled to perceive many long-buried truths. As\nHeaven-sent messengers they went forth, rending asunder the chains of\nerror and superstition, and calling upon those who had been so long\nenslaved, to arise and assert their liberty. \u00a0{GC 79.1}",
                "Except among the Waldenses, the word of God had for ages been locked up\nin languages known only to the learned; but the time had come for the\nScriptures to be translated and given to the people of different lands\nin their native tongue. The world had passed its midnight. The hours of\ndarkness were wearing away, and in many lands appeared tokens of the\ncoming dawn. \u00a0{GC 79.2}",
                "In the fourteenth century arose in England the \"morning star of the\nReformation.\" John Wycliffe was the herald of reform, not for England\nalone, but for all Christendom. The great protest against Rome which it\nwas permitted him to utter was never to be silenced. That protest opened\nthe struggle which was to result in the emancipation of individuals, of\nchurches, and of nations. \u00a0{GC 80.1}",
                "Wycliffe received a liberal education, and with him the fear of the Lord\nwas the beginning of wisdom. He was noted at college for his fervent\npiety as well as for his remarkable talents and sound scholarship. In\nhis thirst for knowledge he sought to become acquainted with every\nbranch of learning. He was educated in the scholastic philosophy, in the\ncanons of the church, and in the civil law, especially that of his own\ncountry. In his after labors the value of this early training was\napparent. A thorough acquaintance with the speculative philosophy of his\ntime enabled him to expose its errors; and by his study of national and\necclesiastical law he was prepared to engage in the great struggle for\ncivil and religious liberty. While he could wield the weapons drawn from\nthe word of God, he had acquired the intellectual discipline of the\nschools, and he understood the tactics of the schoolmen. The power of\nhis genius and the extent and thoroughness of his knowledge commanded\nthe respect of both friends and foes. His adherents saw with\nsatisfaction that their champion stood foremost among the leading minds\nof the nation; and his enemies were prevented from casting contempt upon\nthe cause of reform by exposing the ignorance or weakness of its\nsupporter. \u00a0{GC 80.2}",
                "While Wycliffe was still at college, he entered upon the study of the\nScriptures. In those early times, when the Bible existed only in the\nancient languages, scholars were enabled to find their way to the\nfountain of truth, which was closed to the uneducated classes. Thus\nalready the way had been prepared for Wycliffe's future work as a\nReformer. Men \u00a0of learning had studied the word of God and had found the\ngreat truth of His free grace there revealed. In their teachings they\nhad spread a knowledge of this truth, and had led others to turn to the\nliving oracles. \u00a0{GC 80.3}",
                "When Wycliffe's attention was directed to the Scriptures, he entered\nupon their investigation with the same thoroughness which had enabled\nhim to master the learning of the schools. Heretofore he had felt a\ngreat want, which neither his scholastic studies nor the teaching of the\nchurch could satisfy. In the word of God he found that which he had\nbefore sought in vain. Here he saw the plan of salvation revealed and\nChrist set forth as the only advocate for man. He gave himself to the\nservice of Christ and determined to proclaim the truths he had\ndiscovered. \u00a0{GC 81.1}",
                "Like after Reformers, Wycliffe did not, at the opening of his work,\nforesee whither it would lead him. He did not set himself deliberately\nin opposition to Rome. But devotion to truth could not but bring him in\nconflict with falsehood. The more clearly he discerned the errors of the\npapacy, the more earnestly he presented the teaching of the Bible. He\nsaw that Rome had forsaken the word of God for human tradition; he\nfearlessly accused the priesthood of having banished the Scriptures, and\ndemanded that the Bible be restored to the people and that its authority\nbe again established in the church. He was an able and earnest teacher\nand an eloquent preacher, and his daily life was a demonstration of the\ntruths he preached. His knowledge of the Scriptures, the force of his\nreasoning, the purity of his life, and his unbending courage and\nintegrity won for him general esteem and confidence. Many of the people\nhad become dissatisfied with their former faith as they saw the iniquity\nthat prevailed in the Roman Church, and they hailed with unconcealed joy\nthe truths brought to view by Wycliffe; but the papal leaders were\nfilled with rage when they perceived that this Reformer was gaining an\ninfluence greater than their own. \u00a0{GC 81.2}",
                "Wycliffe was a keen detector of error, and he struck fearlessly against\nmany of the abuses sanctioned by the authority of Rome. While acting as\nchaplain for the king, he took a bold stand against the payment of\ntribute claimed by the pope from the English monarch and showed that the\npapal assumption of authority over secular rulers was contrary to both\nreason and revelation. The demands of the pope had excited great\nindignation, and Wycliffe's teachings exerted an influence upon the\nleading minds of the nation. The king and the nobles united in denying\nthe pontiff's claim to temporal authority and in refusing the payment of\nthe tribute. Thus an effectual blow was struck against the papal\nsupremacy in England. \u00a0{GC 82.1}",
                "Another evil against which the Reformer waged long and resolute battle\nwas the institution of the orders of mendicant friars. These friars\nswarmed in England, casting a blight upon the greatness and prosperity\nof the nation. Industry, education, morals, all felt the withering\ninfluence. The monk's life of idleness and beggary was not only a heavy\ndrain upon the resources of the people, but it brought useful labor into\ncontempt. The youth were demoralized and corrupted. By the influence of\nthe friars many were induced to enter a cloister and devote themselves\nto a monastic life, and this not only without the consent of their\nparents, but even without their knowledge and contrary to their\ncommands. One of the early Fathers of the Roman Church, urging the\nclaims of monasticism above the obligations of filial love and duty, had\ndeclared: \"Though thy father should lie before thy door weeping and\nlamenting, and thy mother should show the body that bore thee and the\nbreasts that nursed thee, see that thou trample them underfoot, and go\nonward straightway to Christ.\" By this \"monstrous inhumanity,\" as Luther\nafterward styled it, \"savoring more of the wolf and the tyrant than of\nthe Christian and the man,\" were the hearts of children steeled against\ntheir parents.---Barnas Sears, \u00a0*The Life of Luther,* \u00a0pages 70, 69. Thus\ndid the papal \u00a0leaders, like the Pharisees of old, make the commandment\nof God of none effect by their tradition. Thus homes were made desolate\nand parents were deprived of the society of their sons and\ndaughters. \u00a0{GC 82.2}",
                "Even the students in the universities were deceived by the false\nrepresentations of the monks and induced to join their orders. Many\nafterward repented this step, seeing that they had blighted their own\nlives and had brought sorrow upon their parents; but once fast in the\nsnare it was impossible for them to obtain their freedom. Many parents,\nfearing the influence of the monks, refused to send their sons to the\nuniversities. There was a marked falling off in the number of students\nin attendance at the great centers of learning. The schools languished,\nand ignorance prevailed. \u00a0{GC 83.1}",
                "The pope had bestowed on these monks the power to hear confessions and\nto grant pardon. This became a source of great evil. Bent on enhancing\ntheir gains, the friars were so ready to grant absolution that criminals\nof all descriptions resorted to them, and, as a result, the worst vices\nrapidly increased. The sick and the poor were left to suffer, while the\ngifts that should have relieved their wants went to the monks, who with\nthreats demanded the alms of the people, denouncing the impiety of those\nwho should withhold gifts from their orders. Notwithstanding their\nprofession of poverty, the wealth of the friars was constantly\nincreasing, and their magnificent edifices and luxurious tables made\nmore apparent the growing poverty of the nation. And while spending\ntheir time in luxury and pleasure, they sent out in their stead ignorant\nmen, who could only recount marvelous tales, legends, and jests to amuse\nthe people and make them still more completely the dupes of the monks.\nYet the friars continued to maintain their hold on the superstitious\nmultitudes and led them to believe that all religious duty was comprised\nin acknowledging the supremacy of the pope, adoring the saints, and\nmaking gifts to the monks, and that this was sufficient to secure them a\nplace in heaven. \u00a0{GC 83.2}",
                "Men of learning and piety had labored in vain to bring about a reform in\nthese monastic orders; but Wycliffe, with clearer insight, struck at the\nroot of the evil, declaring that the system itself was false and that it\nshould be abolished. Discussion and inquiry were awakening. As the monks\ntraversed the country, vending the pope's pardons, many were led to\ndoubt the possibility of purchasing forgiveness with money, and they\nquestioned whether they should not seek pardon from God rather than from\nthe pontiff of Rome. (See \u00a0Appendix \u00a0note for page 59.) Not a few were\nalarmed at the rapacity of the friars, whose greed seemed never to be\nsatisfied. \"The monks and priests of Rome,\" said they, \"are eating us\naway like a cancer. God must deliver us, or the people will\nperish.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 17, ch. 7. To cover their avarice, these\nbegging monks claimed that they were following the Saviour's example,\ndeclaring that Jesus and His disciples had been supported by the\ncharities of the people. This claim resulted in injury to their cause,\nfor it led many to the Bible to learn the truth for themselves---a\nresult which of all others was least desired by Rome. The minds of men\nwere directed to the Source of truth, which it was her object to\nconceal. \u00a0{GC 84.1}",
                "Wycliffe began to write and publish tracts against the friars, not,\nhowever, seeking so much to enter into dispute with them as to call the\nminds of the people to the teachings of the Bible and its Author. He\ndeclared that the power of pardon or of excommunication is possessed by\nthe pope in no greater degree than by common priests, and that no man\ncan be truly excommunicated unless he has first brought upon himself the\ncondemnation of God. In no more effectual way could he have undertaken\nthe overthrow of that mammoth fabric of spiritual and temporal dominion\nwhich the pope had erected and in which the souls and bodies of millions\nwere held captive. \u00a0{GC 84.2}",
                "Again Wycliffe was called to defend the rights of the English crown\nagainst the encroachments of Rome; and being appointed a royal\nambassador, he spent two years in the Netherlands, in conference with\nthe commissioners of the pope. Here he was brought into communication\nwith \u00a0ecclesiastics from France, Italy, and Spain, and he had an\nopportunity to look behind the scenes and gain a knowledge of many\nthings which would have remained hidden from him in England. He learned\nmuch that was to give point to his after labors. In these\nrepresentatives from the papal court he read the true character and aims\nof the hierarchy. He returned to England to repeat his former teachings\nmore openly and with greater zeal, declaring that covetousness, pride,\nand deception were the gods of Rome. \u00a0{GC 84.3}",
                "In one of his tracts he said, speaking of the pope and his collectors:\n\"They draw out of our land poor men's livelihood, and many thousand\nmarks, by the year, of the king's money, for sacraments and spiritual\nthings, that is cursed heresy of simony, and maketh all Christendom\nassent and maintain this heresy. And certes though our realm had a huge\nhill of gold, and never other man took thereof but only this proud\nworldly priest's collector, by process of time this hill must be\nspended; for he taketh ever money out of our land, and sendeth nought\nagain but God's curse for his simony.\"---John Lewis, \u00a0*History of the\nLife and Sufferings of J. Wiclif,* \u00a0page 37. \u00a0{GC 85.1}",
                "Soon after his return to England, Wycliffe received from the king the\nappointment to the rectory of Lutterworth. This was an assurance that\nthe monarch at least had not been displeased by his plain speaking.\nWycliffe's influence was felt in shaping the action of the court, as\nwell as in molding the belief of the nation. \u00a0{GC 85.2}",
                "The papal thunders were soon hurled against him. Three bulls were\ndispatched to England,---to the university, to the king, and to the\nprelates,---all commanding immediate and decisive measures to silence\nthe teacher of heresy. (Augustus Neander, \u00a0*General History of the\nChristian Religion and Church,* \u00a0period 6, sec. 2, pt. 1, par. 8. See\nalso \u00a0Appendix.) Before the arrival of the bulls, however, the bishops,\nin their zeal, had summoned Wycliffe before them for trial. But two of\nthe most powerful princes in the kingdom accompanied him to the\ntribunal; and the people, surrounding the building and rushing in, so\nintimidated the judges that the \u00a0proceedings were for the time suspended,\nand he was allowed to go his way in peace. A little later, Edward III,\nwhom in his old age the prelates were seeking to influence against the\nReformer, died, and Wycliffe's former protector became regent of the\nkingdom. \u00a0{GC 85.3}",
                "But the arrival of the papal bulls laid upon all England a peremptory\ncommand for the arrest and imprisonment of the heretic. These measures\npointed directly to the stake. It appeared certain that Wycliffe must\nsoon fall a prey to the vengeance of Rome. But He who declared to one of\nold, \"Fear not: \\... I am thy shield\" (Genesis 15:1), again stretched\nout His hand to protect His servant. Death came, not to the Reformer,\nbut to the pontiff who had decreed his destruction. Gregory XI died, and\nthe ecclesiastics who had assembled for Wycliffe's trial, dispersed. \u00a0{GC\n86.1}",
                "God's providence still further overruled events to give opportunity for\nthe growth of the Reformation. The death of Gregory was followed by the\nelection of two rival popes. Two conflicting powers, each professedly\ninfallible, now claimed obedience. (See \u00a0Appendix \u00a0notes for pages 50 and\n85.) Each called upon the faithful to assist him in making war upon the\nother, enforcing his demands by terrible anathemas against his\nadversaries, and promises of rewards in heaven to his supporters. This\noccurrence greatly weakened the power of the papacy. The rival factions\nhad all they could do to attack each other, and Wycliffe for a time had\nrest. Anathemas and recriminations were flying from pope to pope, and\ntorrents of blood were poured out to support their conflicting claims.\nCrimes and scandals flooded the church. Meanwhile the Reformer, in the\nquiet retirement of his parish of Lutterworth, was laboring diligently\nto point men from the contending popes to Jesus, the Prince of\nPeace. \u00a0{GC 86.2}",
                "The schism, with all the strife and corruption which it caused, prepared\nthe way for the Reformation by enabling the people to see what the\npapacy really was. In a tract which he published, \u00a0*On the Schism of the\nPopes,* \u00a0Wycliffe called \u00a0upon the people to consider whether these two\npriests were not speaking the truth in condemning each other as the\nantichrist. \"God,\" said he, \"would no longer suffer the fiend to reign\nin only one such priest, but \\... made division among two, so that men,\nin Christ's name, may the more easily overcome them both.\"---R.\nVaughan, \u00a0*Life and Opinions of John de Wycliffe,* \u00a0vol. 2, p. 6. \u00a0{GC\n86.3}",
                "Wycliffe, like his Master, preached the gospel to the poor. Not content\nwith spreading the light in their humble homes in his own parish of\nLutterworth, he determined that it should be carried to every part of\nEngland. To accomplish this he organized a body of preachers, simple,\ndevout men, who loved the truth and desired nothing so much as to extend\nit. These men went everywhere, teaching in the market places, in the\nstreets of the great cities, and in the country lanes. They sought out\nthe aged, the sick, and the poor, and opened to them the glad tidings of\nthe grace of God. \u00a0{GC 87.1}",
                "As a professor of theology at Oxford, Wycliffe preached the word of God\nin the halls of the university. So faithfully did he present the truth\nto the students under his instruction, that he received the title of\n\"the gospel doctor.\" But the greatest work of his life was to be the\ntranslation of the Scriptures into the English language. In a work, \u00a0*On\nthe Truth and Meaning of Scripture,* \u00a0he expressed his intention to\ntranslate the Bible, so that every man in England might read, in the\nlanguage in which he was born, the wonderful works of God. \u00a0{GC 87.2}",
                "But suddenly his labors were stopped. Though not yet sixty years of age,\nunceasing toil, study, and the assaults of his enemies had told upon his\nstrength and made him prematurely old. He was attacked by a dangerous\nillness. The tidings brought great joy to the friars. Now they thought\nhe would bitterly repent the evil he had done the church, and they\nhurried to his chamber to listen to his confession. Representatives from\nthe four religious orders, with four civil officers, gathered about the\nsupposed dying man. \"You \u00a0have death on your lips,\" they said; \"be\ntouched by your faults, and retract in our presence all that you have\nsaid to our injury.\" The Reformer listened in silence; then he bade his\nattendant raise him in his bed, and, gazing steadily upon them as they\nstood waiting for his recantation, he said, in the firm, strong voice\nwhich had so often caused them to tremble: \"I shall not die, but live;\nand again declare the evil deeds of the friars.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 17, ch.\n7.

There were many and great obstacles to surmount\nin the accomplishment of this work. Wycliffe was weighed down with\ninfirmities; he knew that only a few years for labor remained for him;\nhe saw the opposition which he must meet; but, encouraged by the\npromises of God's word, he went forward nothing daunted. In the full\nvigor of his intellectual powers, rich in experience, he had been\npreserved and prepared by God's special providence for this, the\ngreatest of his labors. While all Christendom was filled with tumult,\nthe Reformer in his rectory at Lutterworth, unheeding the storm that\nraged without, applied himself to his chosen task. \u00a0{GC 88.1}",
                "At last the work was completed---the first English translation of the\nBible ever made. The word of God was opened to England. The Reformer\nfeared not now the prison or the stake.

In giving\nthe Bible to his countrymen, he had done more to break the fetters of\nignorance and vice, more to liberate and elevate his country, than was\never achieved by the most brilliant victories on fields of battle. \u00a0{GC\n88.2}",

So great\nwas the interest to obtain the book, that \u00a0many willingly engaged in the\nwork of transcribing it, but it was with difficulty that the copyists\ncould supply the demand. Some of the more wealthy purchasers desired the\nwhole Bible. Others bought only a portion. In many cases, several\nfamilies united to purchase a copy. Thus Wycliffe's Bible soon found its\nway to the homes of the people. \u00a0{GC 88.3}",
                "The appeal to men's reason aroused them from their passive submission to\npapal dogmas.

                "Wycliffe appealed from the synod to Parliament; he fearlessly arraigned\nthe hierarchy before the national council and demanded a reform of the\nenormous abuses sanctioned by the church. With convincing power he\nportrayed the usurpation and corruptions of the papal see. His enemies\nwere brought to confusion. The friends and supporters of Wycliffe had\nbeen forced to yield, and it had been \u00a0confidently expected that the\nReformer himself, in his old age, alone and friendless, would bow to the\ncombined authority of the crown and the miter.

The power\nof the Holy Spirit was felt in the council room. A spell from God was\nupon the hearers. They seemed to have no power to leave the place.

Here was the\nsource of that stream of blessing, which, like the water of life, has\nflowed down the ages since the fourteenth century. Wycliffe accepted the\nHoly Scriptures with implicit faith as the inspired revelation of God's\nwill, a sufficient rule of faith and practice. He had been educated to\nregard the Church of Rome as the divine, infallible authority, and to\naccept with unquestioning reverence the established teachings and\ncustoms of a thousand years; but he turned away from all these to listen\nto God's holy word. This was the authority which he urged the people to\nacknowledge. Instead of the church speaking through the pope, he\ndeclared the only true authority to be the voice of God speaking through\nHis word. And he taught not only that the Bible is a perfect revelation\nof God's will, but that the Holy Spirit is its only interpreter, and\nthat every man is, by the study of its teachings, to learn his duty for\nhimself.

Now that their leader was removed, the preachers labored\nwith even greater zeal than before, and multitudes flocked to listen to\ntheir teachings. Some of the nobility, and even the wife of the king,\nwere among the converts.

Like the\ndisciples in apostolic days, many sacrificed their worldly possessions\nfor the cause of Christ. Those who were permitted to dwell in their\nhomes gladly sheltered their banished brethren, and when they too were\ndriven forth they cheerfully accepted the lot of the outcast. Thousands,\nit is true, terrified by the fury of their persecutors, purchased their\nfreedom at the sacrifice of their faith, and went out of their prisons,\nclothed in penitents' robes, to publish their recantation.

But as the power of the pope increased, so the\nword of God was obscured. Gregory VII, who had taken it upon himself to\nhumble the pride of kings, was no less intent upon enslaving the people,\nand accordingly a bull was issued forbidding public worship to be\nconducted in the Bohemian tongue. The pope declared that \"it was\npleasing to the Omnipotent that His worship should be celebrated in an\nunknown language, and that many evils and heresies had arisen from not\nobserving this rule.\"---Wylie, b. 3, ch. 1. Thus Rome decreed that the\nlight of God's word should be extinguished and the people should be shut\nup in darkness. But Heaven had provided other agencies for the\npreservation of the church. Many of the Waldenses and Albigenses, driven\nby persecution from their homes in France and Italy, came to Bohemia.\nThough they dared not teach openly, they labored zealously in secret.\nThus the true faith was preserved from century to century. \u00a0{GC 97.1}",

The fears of the hierarchy\nwere roused, and persecution was opened against the disciples of the\ngospel. \u00a0Driven to worship in the forests and the mountains, they were\nhunted by soldiers, and many were put to death. After a time it was\ndecreed that all who departed from the Romish worship should be burned.\nBut while the Christians yielded up their lives, they looked forward to\nthe triumph of their cause. One of those who \"taught that salvation was\nonly to be found by faith in the crucified Saviour,\" declared when\ndying: \"The rage of the enemies of the truth now prevails against us,\nbut it will not be forever; there shall arise one from among the common\npeople, without sword or authority, and against him they shall not be\nable to prevail.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 3, ch. 1.

His pious mother, regarding education and the fear of God\nas the most valuable of possessions, sought to secure this heritage for\nher son. Huss studied at the provincial school, and then repaired to the\nuniversity at Prague, receiving admission as a charity scholar. He was\naccompanied on the journey to Prague by his mother; widowed and poor,\nshe had no gifts of worldly wealth to bestow upon her son, but as they\ndrew near to the great city, she kneeled down beside the fatherless\nyouth and invoked for him the blessing of their Father in heaven. Little\ndid that mother realize how her prayer was to be answered. \u00a0{GC 98.1}",
                "At the university, Huss soon distinguished himself by his untiring\napplication and rapid progress, while his blameless life and gentle,\nwinning deportment gained him universal esteem. He was a sincere\nadherent of the Roman Church and an earnest seeker for the spiritual\nblessings which it professes to bestow. On the occasion of a jubilee he\nwent to confession, paid the last few coins in his scanty store, and\njoined in the processions, that he might share in the absolution\npromised. After completing his college course, he entered the\npriesthood, and rapidly attaining to eminence, \u00a0he soon became attached\nto the court of the king.

                "But it was in another field that Huss began the work of reform. Several\nyears after taking priest's orders he was appointed preacher of the\nchapel of Bethlehem. The founder of this chapel had advocated, as a\nmatter of great importance, the preaching of the Scriptures in the\nlanguage of the people. Notwithstanding Rome's opposition to this\npractice, it had not been wholly discontinued in Bohemia. But there was\ngreat ignorance of the Bible, and the worst vices prevailed among the\npeople of all ranks.

                "A citizen of Prague, Jerome, who afterward became so closely associated\nwith Huss, had, on returning from England, brought with him the writings\nof Wycliffe. The queen of England, who had been a convert to Wycliffe's\nteachings, was a Bohemian princess, and through her influence also the\nReformer's works were widely circulated in her native country. These\nworks Huss read with interest; he believed their author to be a sincere\nChristian and was inclined to regard with favor the reforms which he\nadvocated. Already, though he knew it not, Huss had entered upon a path\nwhich was to lead him far away from Rome. \u00a0{GC 99.2}",

Being artists as well as preachers, they proceeded to exercise\ntheir skill. In a place open to the public they drew two pictures. One\nrepresented the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem, \u00a0\"meek, and sitting\nupon an ass\" (Matthew 21:5), and followed by His disciples in\ntravel-worn garments and with naked feet. The other picture portrayed a\npontifical procession---the pope arrayed in his rich robes and triple\ncrown, mounted upon a horse magnificently adorned, preceded by\ntrumpeters and followed by cardinals and prelates in dazzling array. \u00a0{GC\n99.3}",

There was great commotion in Prague, and the\nstrangers after a time found it necessary, for their own safety, to\ndepart. But the lesson they had taught was not forgotten. The pictures\nmade a deep impression on the mind of Huss and led him to a closer study\nof the Bible and of Wycliffe's writings. Though he was not prepared,\neven yet, to accept all the reforms advocated by Wycliffe, he saw more\nclearly the true character of the papacy, and with greater zeal\ndenounced the pride, the ambition, and the corruption of the\nhierarchy. \u00a0{GC 100.1}",

The ceremonies by which it was accompanied were well adapted to\nstrike terror to a people who looked upon the pope as the representative\nof God Himself, holding the keys of heaven and hell, and possessing\npower to invoke temporal as well as spiritual judgments. It was believed\nthat the gates of heaven were closed against the region smitten with\ninterdict; that until it should please the pope to remove the ban, the\ndead were shut out from the abodes of bliss. In token of this terrible\ncalamity, all the services of religion were suspended. The churches were\nclosed. Marriages were solemnized in the churchyard. The dead, denied\nburial in consecrated ground, were interred, without the rites of\nsepulture, in the ditches or the fields.

To quiet the storm, the Reformer withdrew for a\ntime to his native village. Writing to the friends whom he had left at\nPrague, he said: \"If I have withdrawn from the midst of you, it is to\nfollow the precept and example of Jesus Christ, in order not to give\nroom to the ill-minded to draw on themselves eternal condemnation, and\nin order not to be to the pious a cause of affliction and persecution. I\nhave retired also through an apprehension that impious priests might\ncontinue for a longer time to prohibit the preaching of the word of God\namongst you; but I have not quitted you to deny the divine truth, for\nwhich, with God's assistance, I am willing to die.\"---Bonnechose, \u00a0*The\nReformers Before the Reformation,* \u00a0vol. 1, p. 87. Huss did not cease his\nlabors, but traveled through the surrounding country, preaching to eager\ncrowds.

Although the church was seeking to\noverwhelm him by her thunderbolts, he had not renounced her authority.\nThe Roman Church was still to him the spouse of Christ, and the pope was\nthe representative and vicar of God. What Huss was warring against was\nthe abuse of authority, not the principle itself. This brought on a\nterrible conflict between the convictions of his understanding and the\nclaims of his conscience. If the authority was just and infallible, as\nhe believed it to be, how came it that he felt compelled to disobey it?\nTo obey, he saw, was to sin; but why should obedience to an infallible\nchurch lead to such an issue? This was the problem he could not solve;\nthis was the doubt that tortured him hour by hour. The nearest\napproximation to a solution which he was able to make was that it had\nhappened again, as once before in the days of the Saviour, that the\npriests of the church had become wicked persons and were using their\nlawful authority for unlawful ends. This led him to adopt for his own\nguidance, and to preach to others for theirs, the maxim that the\nprecepts of Scripture, conveyed through the understanding, are to rule\nthe conscience; in other words, that God speaking in the Bible, and not\nthe church speaking through the priesthood, is the one infallible\nguide.\"---Wylie, b. 3, ch. 2. \u00a0{GC 102.1}",

Brilliancy of genius, eloquence and\nlearning---gifts that win popular favor---were possessed in a\npre-eminent degree by Jerome; but in those qualities which constitute\nreal strength of character, Huss was the greater. His calm judgment\nserved as a restraint upon the impulsive spirit of Jerome, who, with\ntrue humility, perceived his worth, and yielded to his counsels.

                "The chief objects to be accomplished by the council were to heal the\nschism in the church and to root out heresy. Hence the two antipopes\nwere summoned to appear before it, as well as the leading propagator of\nthe new opinions, John Huss. The former, having regard to their own\nsafety, did not attend in person, but were represented by their\ndelegates. Pope John, while ostensibly the convoker of the council, came\nto it with many misgivings, suspecting the emperor's secret purpose to\ndepose him, and fearing to be brought to account for the vices which had\ndisgraced the tiara, as well as for the crimes which had secured it. Yet\nhe made his entry into the city of Constance with great pomp, attended\nby ecclesiastics of the highest rank and followed by a train of\ncourtiers. All the clergy and dignitaries of the city, with an immense\ncrowd of citizens, went out to welcome him. Above his head was a golden\ncanopy, borne by four of the chief magistrates. The host was carried\nbefore him, and the rich dresses of the cardinals and nobles made an\nimposing display. \u00a0{GC 104.3}",
                "Meanwhile another traveler was approaching Constance. Huss was conscious\nof the dangers which threatened him. \u00a0He parted from his friends as if he\nwere never to meet them again, and went on his journey feeling that it\nwas leading him to the stake. Notwithstanding he had obtained a\nsafe-conduct from the king of Bohemia, and received one also from the\nemperor Sigismund while on his journey, he made all his arrangements in\nview of the probability of his death. \u00a0{GC 104.4}",
                "In a letter addressed to his friends at Prague he said: \"My brethren,\n\\... I am departing with a safe-conduct from the king to meet my\nnumerous and mortal enemies\\.... I confide altogether in the\nall-powerful God, in my Saviour; I trust that He will listen to your\nardent prayers, that He will infuse His prudence and His wisdom into my\nmouth, in order that I may resist them; and that He will accord me His\nHoly Spirit to fortify me in His truth, so that I may face with courage,\ntemptations, prison, and, if necessary, a cruel death. Jesus Christ\nsuffered for His well-beloved; and therefore ought we to be astonished\nthat He has left us His example, in order that we may ourselves endure\nwith patience all things for our own salvation? He is God, and we are\nHis creatures; He is the Lord, and we are His servants; He is Master of\nthe world, and we are contemptible mortals---yet He suffered! Why, then,\nshould we not suffer also, particularly when suffering is for us a\npurification? Therefore, beloved, if my death ought to contribute to His\nglory, pray that it may come quickly, and that He may enable me to\nsupport all my calamities with constancy. But if it be better that I\nreturn amongst you, let us pray to God that I may return without\nstain---that is, that I may not suppress one tittle of the truth of the\ngospel, in order to leave my brethren an excellent example to follow.\nProbably, therefore, you will nevermore behold my face at Prague; but\nshould the will of the all-powerful God deign to restore me to you, let\nus then advance with a firmer heart in the knowledge and the love of His\nlaw.\"---Bonnechose, vol. 1, pp. 147, 148. \u00a0{GC 105.1}",
                "In another letter, to a priest who had become a disciple of the gospel,\nHuss spoke with deep humility of his own errors, accusing himself \"of\nhaving felt pleasure in wearing \u00a0rich apparel and of having wasted hours\nin frivolous occupations.\" He then added these touching admonitions:\n\"May the glory of God and the salvation of souls occupy thy mind, and\nnot the possession of benefices and estates. Beware of adorning thy\nhouse more than thy soul; and, above all, give thy care to the spiritual\nedifice. Be pious and humble with the poor, and consume not thy\nsubstance in feasting. Shouldst thou not amend thy life and refrain from\nsuperfluities, I fear that thou wilt be severely chastened, as I am\nmyself\\.... Thou knowest my doctrine, for thou hast received my\ninstructions from thy childhood; it is therefore useless for me to write\nto thee any further. But I conjure thee, by the mercy of our Lord, not\nto imitate me in any of the vanities into which thou hast seen me fall.\"\nOn the cover of the letter he added: \"I conjure thee, my friend, not to\nbreak this seal until thou shalt have acquired the certitude that I am\ndead.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0vol. 1, pp. 148, 149. \u00a0{GC 105.2}",
                "On his journey, Huss everywhere beheld indications of the spread of his\ndoctrines and the favor with which his cause was regarded. The people\nthronged to meet him, and in some towns the magistrates attended him\nthrough their streets. \u00a0{GC 106.1}",
                "Upon arriving at Constance, Huss was granted full liberty. To the\nemperor's safe-conduct was added a personal assurance of protection by\nthe pope. But, in violation of these solemn and repeated declarations,\nthe Reformer was in a short time arrested, by order of the pope and\ncardinals, and thrust into a loathsome dungeon. Later he was transferred\nto a strong castle across the Rhine and there kept a prisoner. The pope,\nprofiting little by his perfidy, was soon after committed to the same\nprison. \u00a0*Ibid.,* \u00a0vol. 1, p. 247. He had been proved before the council\nto be guilty of the basest crimes, besides murder, simony, and adultery,\n\"sins not fit to be named.\" So the council itself declared, and he was\nfinally deprived of the tiara and thrown into prison. The antipopes also\nwere deposed, and a new pontiff was chosen. \u00a0{GC 106.2}",
                "Though the pope himself had been guilty of greater crimes than Huss had\never charged upon the priests, and for which he had demanded a\nreformation, yet the same council which degraded the pontiff proceeded\nto crush the Reformer. The imprisonment of Huss excited great\nindignation in Bohemia. Powerful noblemen addressed to the council\nearnest protests against this outrage. The emperor, who was loath to\npermit the violation of a safe-conduct, opposed the proceedings against\nhim. But the enemies of the Reformer were malignant and determined. They\nappealed to the emperor's prejudices, to his fears, to his zeal for the\nchurch. They brought forward arguments of great length to prove that\n\"faith ought not to be kept with heretics, nor persons suspected of\nheresy, though they are furnished with safe-conducts from the emperor\nand kings.\"---Jacques Lenfant, \u00a0*History of the Council of\nConstance,* \u00a0vol. 1, p. 516.

                "Enfeebled by illness and imprisonment,---for the damp, foul air of his\ndungeon had brought on a fever which nearly ended his life,---Huss was\nat last brought before the council. Loaded with chains he stood in the\npresence of the emperor, whose honor and good faith had been pledged to\nprotect him. During his long trial he firmly maintained the truth, and\nin the presence of the assembled dignitaries of church and state he\nuttered a solemn and faithful protest against the corruptions of the\nhierarchy. When required to choose whether he would recant his doctrines\nor suffer death, he accepted the martyr's fate. \u00a0{GC 107.2}",
                "The grace of God sustained him. During the weeks of suffering that\npassed before his final sentence, heaven's peace filled his soul. \"I\nwrite this letter,\" he said to a friend, \"in my prison, and with my\nfettered hand, expecting my sentence of death tomorrow\\.... When, with\nthe assistance of Jesus Christ, we shall again meet in the delicious\npeace of the future life, you will learn how merciful God has shown\nHimself toward me, how effectually He has supported me in the midst of\nmy temptations and trials.\"---Bonnechose, vol. 2, p. 67. \u00a0{GC 107.3}",

As soon as their task\nwas ended, the painters, who were surrounded by an immense crowd,\nexclaimed, 'Now let the popes and bishops come; they shall never efface\nthem more!'\" Said the Reformer, as he related his dream: \"I maintain\nthis for certain, that the image of Christ will never be effaced. They\nhave wished to destroy it, but it shall be painted afresh in all hearts\nby much better preachers than myself.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 1, ch. 6. \u00a0{GC\n108.1}",
                "For the last time, Huss was brought before the council. It was a vast\nand brilliant assembly---the emperor, the princes of the empire, the\nroyal deputies, the cardinals, bishops, and priests, and an immense\ncrowd who had come as spectators of the events of the day. From all\nparts of Christendom had been gathered the witnesses of this first great\nsacrifice in the long struggle by which liberty of conscience was to be\nsecured. \u00a0{GC 108.2}",
                "Being called upon for his final decision, Huss declared his refusal to\nabjure, and, fixing his penetrating glance upon the monarch whose\nplighted word had been so shamelessly violated, he declared: \"I\ndetermined, of my own free will, to appear before this council, under\nthe public protection and faith of the emperor here\npresent.\"---Bonnechose, vol. 2, p. 84.

Being again exhorted to retract, he\nreplied, turning toward the people: \"With what face, then, should I\nbehold the heavens? How should I look on those multitudes of men to whom\nI have preached the pure gospel? No; I esteem their salvation more than\nthis poor body, now appointed unto death.\" The vestments were removed\none by one, each bishop pronouncing a curse as he performed his part of\nthe ceremony. Finally \"they put on his head a cap or pyramidal-shaped\nmiter of paper, on which were painted frightful figures of demons, with\nthe word 'Archheretic' conspicuous in front.

An immense procession followed, hundreds of men at\narms, priests and bishops in their costly robes, and the inhabitants of\nConstance. When he had been fastened to the stake, and all was ready for\nthe fire to be lighted, the martyr was once more exhorted to save\nhimself by renouncing his errors. \"What errors,\" said Huss, \"shall I\nrenounce? I know myself guilty of none. I call God to witness that all\nthat I have written and preached has been with the view of rescuing\nsouls from sin and perdition; and, therefore, most joyfully will I\nconfirm with my blood that truth which I have written and\npreached.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 3, ch. 7.

They prepared for the fire as if they were going to a\nmarriage feast. They uttered no cry of pain. When the flames rose, they\nbegan to sing hymns; and scarce could the vehemency of the fire stop\ntheir singing.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 3, ch. 7. \u00a0{GC 109.3}",
                "When the body of Huss had been wholly consumed, his ashes, with the soil\nupon which they rested, were gathered up and cast into the Rhine, and\nthus borne onward to the ocean. His persecutors vainly imagined that\nthey had rooted out the truths he preached. Little did they dream that\nthe ashes that day borne away to the sea were to be as seed scattered in\nall the countries of the earth; that in lands yet unknown it would yield\nabundant fruit in witnesses for the truth. The voice which had spoken in\nthe council hall of Constance had wakened echoes that would be heard\nthrough all coming ages. Huss was no more, but the truths for which he\ndied could never perish. His example of faith and constancy would\nencourage multitudes to stand firm for the truth, in the face of torture\nand death. His execution had exhibited to the whole world the perfidious\ncruelty of Rome. The enemies of truth, though they knew it not, had been\nfurthering the cause which they vainly sought to destroy. \u00a0{GC 110.1}",
                "Yet another stake was to be set up at Constance. The blood of another\nwitness must testify for the truth. Jerome, upon bidding farewell to\nHuss on his departure for the council, had exhorted him to courage and\nfirmness, declaring that if he should fall into any peril, he himself\nwould fly to his assistance. Upon hearing of the Reformer's\nimprisonment, the faithful disciple immediately prepared to fulfill his\npromise. Without a safe-conduct he set out, with a single companion, for\nConstance. On arriving there he was convinced that he had only exposed\nhimself to peril, without the possibility of doing anything for the\ndeliverance of Huss. He fled from the city, but was arrested on the\nhomeward journey and brought back loaded with fetters and under the\ncustody of a band of soldiers. At his first appearance before \u00a0the\ncouncil his attempts to reply to the accusations brought against him\nwere met with shouts, \"To the flames with him! to the\nflames!\"---Bonnechose, vol. 1, p. 234. He was thrown into a dungeon,\nchained in a position which caused him great suffering, and fed on bread\nand water. After some months the cruelties of his imprisonment brought\nupon Jerome an illness that threatened his life, and his enemies,\nfearing that he might escape them, treated him with less severity,\nthough he remained in prison for one year. \u00a0{GC 110.2}",
                "The death of Huss had not resulted as the papists had hoped. The\nviolation of his safe-conduct had roused a storm of indignation, and as\nthe safer course, the council determined, instead of burning Jerome, to\nforce him, if possible, to retract. He was brought before the assembly,\nand offered the alternative to recant, or to die at the stake. Death at\nthe beginning of his imprisonment would have been a mercy in comparison\nwith the terrible sufferings which he had undergone; but now, weakened\nby illness, by the rigors of his prison house, and the torture of\nanxiety and suspense, separated from his friends, and disheartened by\nthe death of Huss, Jerome's fortitude gave way, and he consented to\nsubmit to the council. He pledged himself to adhere to the Catholic\nfaith, and accepted the action of the council in condemning the\ndoctrines of Wycliffe and Huss, excepting, however, the \"holy truths\"\nwhich they had taught.---*Ibid,* \u00a0vol. 2, p. 141. \u00a0{GC 111.1}",
                "By this expedient Jerome endeavored to silence the voice of conscience\nand escape his doom. But in the solitude of his dungeon he saw more\nclearly what he had done. He thought of the courage and fidelity of\nHuss, and in contrast pondered upon his own denial of the truth. He\nthought of the divine Master whom he had pledged himself to serve, and\nwho for his sake endured the death of the cross. Before his retraction\nhe had found comfort, amid all his sufferings, in the assurance of God's\nfavor; but now remorse and doubts tortured his soul. He knew that still\nother retractions must be made before he could be at peace with Rome.\nThe path upon \u00a0which he was entering could end only in complete apostasy.\nHis resolution was taken: To escape a brief period of suffering he would\nnot deny his Lord. \u00a0{GC 111.2}",
                "Soon he was again brought before the council. His submission had not\nsatisfied his judges. Their thirst for blood, whetted by the death of\nHuss, clamored for fresh victims. Only by an unreserved surrender of the\ntruth could Jerome preserve his life. But he had determined to avow his\nfaith and follow his brother martyr to the flames. \u00a0{GC 112.1}",
                "He renounced his former recantation and, as a dying man, solemnly\nrequired an opportunity to make his defense. Fearing the effect of his\nwords, the prelates insisted that he should merely affirm or deny the\ntruth of the charges brought against him. Jerome protested against such\ncruelty and injustice. \"You have held me shut up three hundred and forty\ndays in a frightful prison,\" he said, \"in the midst of filth,\nnoisomeness, stench, and the utmost want of everything; you then bring\nme out before you, and lending an ear to my mortal enemies, you refuse\nto hear me\\.... If you be really wise men, and the lights of the world,\ntake care not to sin against justice. As to me, I am only a feeble\nmortal; my life is but of little importance; and when I exhort you not\nto deliver an unjust sentence, I speak less for myself than for\nyou.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0vol. 2, pp. 146, 147. \u00a0{GC 112.2}",
                "His request was finally granted. In the presence of his judges, Jerome\nkneeled down and prayed that the divine Spirit might control his\nthoughts and words, that he might speak nothing contrary to the truth or\nunworthy of his Master. To him that day was fulfilled the promise of God\nto the first disciples: \"Ye shall be brought before governors and kings\nfor My sake\\.... But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or\nwhat ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye\nshall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father\nwhich speaketh in you.\" \u00a0Matthew 10:18-20. \u00a0{GC 112.3}",
                "The words of Jerome excited astonishment and admiration, even in his\nenemies. For a whole year he had been \u00a0immured in a dungeon, unable to\nread or even to see, in great physical suffering and mental anxiety. Yet\nhis arguments were presented with as much clearness and power as if he\nhad had undisturbed opportunity for study. He pointed his hearers to the\nlong line of holy men who had been condemned by unjust judges. In almost\nevery generation have been those who, while seeking to elevate the\npeople of their time, have been reproached and cast out, but who in\nlater times have been shown to be deserving of honor. Christ Himself was\ncondemned as a malefactor at an unrighteous tribunal. \u00a0{GC 112.4}",
                "At his retraction, Jerome had assented to the justice of the sentence\ncondemning Huss; he now declared his repentance and bore witness to the\ninnocence and holiness of the martyr. \"I knew him from his childhood,\"\nhe said. \"He was a most excellent man, just and holy; he was condemned,\nnotwithstanding his innocence\\.... I also---I am ready to die: I will\nnot recoil before the torments that are prepared for me by my enemies\nand false witnesses, who will one day have to render an account of their\nimpostures before the great God, whom nothing can\ndeceive.\"---Bonnechose, vol. 2, p. 151. \u00a0{GC 113.1}",
                "In self-reproach for his own denial of the truth, Jerome continued: \"Of\nall the sins that I have committed since my youth, none weigh so heavily\non my mind, and cause me such poignant remorse, as that which I\ncommitted in this fatal place, when I approved of the iniquitous\nsentence rendered against Wycliffe, and against the holy martyr, John\nHuss, my master and my friend. Yes! I confess it from my heart, and\ndeclare with horror that I disgracefully quailed when, through a dread\nof death, I condemned their doctrines. I therefore supplicate \\...\nAlmighty God to deign to pardon me my sins, and this one in particular,\nthe most heinous of all.\" Pointing to his judges, he said firmly: \"You\ncondemned Wycliffe and John Huss, not for having shaken the doctrine of\nthe church, but simply because they branded with reprobation the\nscandals proceeding from the clergy---their pomp, their pride, and all\nthe vices of the prelates and priests. \u00a0The things which they have\naffirmed, and which are irrefutable, I also think and declare, like\nthem.\" \u00a0{GC 113.2}",

                "Unmoved by the tempest, Jerome exclaimed: \"What! do you suppose that I\nfear to die? You have held me for a whole year in a frightful dungeon,\nmore horrible than death itself. You have treated me more cruelly than a\nTurk, Jew, or pagan, and my flesh has literally rotted off my bones\nalive; and yet I make no complaint, for lamentation ill becomes a man of\nheart and spirit; but I cannot but express my astonishment at such great\nbarbarity toward a Christian.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0vol. 2, pp. 151-153. \u00a0{GC\n114.2}",
                "Again the storm of rage burst out, and Jerome was hurried away to\nprison. Yet there were some in the assembly upon whom his words had made\na deep impression and who desired to save his life. He was visited by\ndignitaries of the church and urged to submit himself to the council.\nThe most brilliant prospects were presented before him as the reward of\nrenouncing his opposition to Rome.

                "\"Are the traditions of men more worthy of faith than the gospel of our\nSaviour?\" replied Jerome. \"Paul did not exhort those to whom he wrote to\nlisten to the traditions of men, but said, 'Search the Scriptures.'\" \u00a0{GC\n114.6}",

                "Erelong sentence of condemnation was passed upon him. He was led out to\nthe same spot upon which Huss had \u00a0yielded up his life. He went singing\non his way, his countenance lighted up with joy and peace. His gaze was\nfixed upon Christ, and to him death had lost its terrors.

Ziska, who soon after the opening of the\nwar became totally blind, yet who was one of the ablest generals of his\nage, was the leader of the Bohemians. Trusting in the help of God and\nthe righteousness of their cause, that people withstood the mightiest\narmies that could be brought against them. Again and again the emperor,\nraising fresh armies, invaded Bohemia, only to be ignominiously\nrepulsed. The Hussites were raised above the fear of death, and nothing\ncould stand against them.

Another crusade was proclaimed. In all the papal countries of\nEurope, men, money, and munitions of war were raised. Multitudes flocked\nto the papal standard, assured that at last an end would be made of the\nHussite heretics. Confident of victory, the vast force entered Bohemia.\nThe people rallied to repel them. The two armies approached each other\nuntil only a river lay between them. \"The crusaders were in greatly\nsuperior force, but instead of dashing across the stream, and closing in\nbattle with the Hussites whom they had come so far to meet, they stood\ngazing in silence at those warriors.\"---Wylie, b. 3, ch. 17.

All who died in the war were\npromised a rich reward in heaven, and those who survived were to reap\nhonor and riches on the field of battle. Again a vast army was\ncollected, and, crossing the frontier they entered Bohemia. The Hussite\nforces fell back before them, thus drawing the invaders farther and\nfarther into the country, and leading them to count the victory already\nwon. At last the army of Procopius made a stand, and turning upon the\nfoe, advanced to give them battle. The crusaders, now discovering their\nmistake, lay in their encampment awaiting the onset. As the sound of the\napproaching force was heard, even before the Hussites were in sight, a\npanic again fell upon the crusaders. Princes, generals, and common\nsoldiers, casting away their armor, fled in all directions. In vain the\npapal legate, who was the leader of the invasion, endeavored to rally\nhis terrified and disorganized forces.

Here was a manifestation of divine power. The\ninvaders were smitten with a supernatural terror. He who overthrew the\nhosts of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, who put to flight the armies of Midian\nbefore Gideon and his three hundred, who in one night laid low the\nforces of the proud Assyrian, had again stretched out His hand to wither\nthe power of the oppressor. \"There were they in great fear, where no\nfear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against\nthee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised\nthem.\" \u00a0Psalm 53:5. \u00a0{GC 117.1}",

The Bohemians had specified four points as the\ncondition of peace with Rome: the free preaching of the Bible; the right\nof the whole church to both the bread and the wine in the communion, and\nthe use of the mother tongue in divine worship; the exclusion of the\nclergy from all secular offices and authority; and, in cases of crime,\nthe jurisdiction of the civil courts over clergy and laity alike.

                "Like the first heralds of the gospel, Luther sprang from the ranks of\npoverty. His early years were spent in the humble home of a German\npeasant. By daily toil as a miner his father earned the means for his\neducation. He intended him for a lawyer; but God purposed to make him a\nbuilder in the great temple that was rising so slowly through the\ncenturies. Hardship, privation, and severe discipline were the school in\nwhich Infinite Wisdom prepared Luther for the important mission of his\nlife. \u00a0{GC 120.2}",
                "Luther's father was a man of strong and active mind and great force of\ncharacter, honest, resolute, and straightforward. He was true to his\nconvictions of duty, let the consequences be what they might. His\nsterling good sense led him to regard the monastic system with distrust.\nHe was highly displeased when Luther, without his consent, entered a\nmonastery; and it was two years before the father was reconciled to his\nson, and even then his opinions remained the same. \u00a0{GC 120.3}",
                "Luther's parents bestowed great care upon the education and training of\ntheir children. They endeavored to instruct them in the knowledge of God\nand the practice of Christian virtues. The father's prayer often\nascended in the hearing of his son that the child might remember the\nname of the Lord and one day aid in the advancement of His truth. Every\nadvantage for moral or intellectual culture which their life of toil\npermitted them to enjoy was eagerly improved by these parents. Their\nefforts were earnest and persevering to prepare their children for a\nlife of piety and usefulness. With their firmness and strength of\ncharacter they sometimes exercised too great severity; but the Reformer\nhimself, though conscious that in some respects they had erred, found in\ntheir discipline more to approve than to condemn. \u00a0{GC 121.1}",
                "At school, where he was sent at an early age, Luther was treated with\nharshness and even violence. So great was the poverty of his parents\nthat upon going from home to school in another town he was for a time\nobliged to obtain his food by singing from door to door, and he often\nsuffered from hunger. The gloomy, superstitious ideas of religion then\nprevailing filled him with fear. He would lie down at night with a\nsorrowful heart, looking forward with trembling to the dark future and\nin constant terror at the thought of God as a stern, unrelenting judge,\na cruel tyrant, rather than a kind heavenly Father. \u00a0{GC 121.2}",

And the\ninfluence of \u00a0judicious friends had somewhat lessened the gloomy effects\nof his former training. He applied himself to the study of the best\nauthors, diligently treasuring their most weighty thoughts and making\nthe wisdom of the wise his own.

He had heard portions of the\nGospels and Epistles, which were read to the people at public worship,\nand he supposed that these were the entire Bible. Now, for the first\ntime, he looked upon the whole of God's word. With mingled awe and\nwonder he turned the sacred pages; with quickened pulse and throbbing\nheart he read for himself the words of life, pausing now and then to\nexclaim: \"O that God would give me such a book for\nmyself!\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 2, ch. 2.

Above everything else he delighted in the study of God's\nword. He had found a Bible chained to the convent wall, and to this he\noften repaired. As his convictions of sin deepened, he sought by his own\nworks to obtain pardon and peace. He led a most rigorous life,\nendeavoring by fasting, vigils, and scourgings to subdue the evils of\nhis nature, from which the monastic life had brought no release. He\nshrank from no sacrifice by which he might attain to that purity of\nheart which would enable him to stand approved before God. \"I was indeed\na pious monk,\" he afterward said, \"and followed the rules of my order\nmore strictly than I can express.

Staupitz, his friend and superior, urged him to ascend the\npulpit and preach the word of God. Luther hesitated, feeling himself\nunworthy to speak to the people in Christ's stead. It was only after a\nlong struggle that he yielded to the solicitations of his friends.\nAlready he was mighty in the Scriptures, and the grace of God rested\nupon him.

He pursued his journey on foot, lodging at the monasteries\non the way. At a convent in Italy he was filled with wonder at the\nwealth, magnificence, and luxury that he witnessed. Endowed with a\nprincely revenue, the monks dwelt in splendid apartments, attired\nthemselves in the richest and most costly robes, and feasted at a\nsumptuous table. With painful misgivings Luther contrasted this scene\nwith the self-denial and hardship of his own life. His mind was becoming\nperplexed. \u00a0{GC 124.2}",

He entered the city, visited the\nchurches, listened to the marvelous tales repeated by priests and monks,\nand performed all the ceremonies required. Everywhere he looked upon\nscenes that filled him with astonishment and horror. He saw that\niniquity existed among all classes of the clergy. He heard indecent\njokes from prelates, and was filled with horror at their awful\nprofanity, even during mass. As he mingled with the monks and citizens\nhe met dissipation, debauchery. Turn where he would, in the place of\nsanctity he found profanation. \"No one can imagine,\" he wrote, \"what\nsins and infamous actions are committed in Rome; they must be seen and\nheard to be believed.

He\nsprang to his feet and hastened from the place in shame and horror. That\ntext never lost its power upon his soul. From that time he saw more\nclearly than ever before the fallacy of trusting to human works for\nsalvation, and the necessity of constant faith in the merits of Christ.\nHis eyes had been opened, and were never again to be closed, to the\ndelusions of the papacy. When he turned his face from Rome he had turned\naway also in heart, and from that time the separation grew wider, until\nhe severed all connection with the papal church. \u00a0{GC 125.1}",

The whole scheme\nwas a farce,---an artifice to extort money by playing upon the\nsuperstitions of the people,---a device of Satan to destroy the souls of\nall who should trust to its lying pretensions. It was also clearly shown\nthat the gospel of Christ is the most valuable treasure of the church,\nand that the grace of God, therein revealed, is freely bestowed upon all\nwho seek it by repentance and faith. \u00a0{GC 130.1}",
                "Luther's theses challenged discussion; but no one dared accept the\nchallenge. The questions which he proposed had in a few days spread\nthrough all Germany, and in a few weeks they had sounded throughout\nChristendom. Many devoted Romanists, who had seen and lamented the\nterrible iniquity prevailing in the church, but had not known how to\narrest its progress, read the propositions with great joy, recognizing\nin them the voice of God. They felt that the Lord had graciously set His\nhand to arrest the rapidly swelling tide of corruption that was issuing\nfrom the see of Rome. Princes and magistrates secretly rejoiced that a\ncheck was to be put upon the arrogant power which denied the right of\nappeal from its decisions. \u00a0{GC 130.2}",

Crafty\necclesiastics, interrupted in their work of sanctioning crime, and\nseeing their gains endangered, were enraged, and rallied to uphold their\npretensions. The Reformer had bitter accusers to meet. Some charged him\nwith acting hastily and from impulse. Others accused him of presumption,\ndeclaring that he was not directed of God, but was acting from pride and\nforwardness. \"Who does not \u00a0know,\" he responded, \"that a man rarely puts\nforth any new idea without having some appearance of pride, and without\nbeing accused of exciting quarrels? \\... Why were Christ and all the\nmartyrs put to death?

                "Though Luther had been moved by the Spirit of God to begin his work, he\nwas not to carry it forward without severe conflicts. The reproaches of\nhis enemies, their misrepresentation of his purposes, and their unjust\nand malicious reflections upon his character and motives, came in upon\nhim like an overwhelming flood; and they were not without effect. He had\nfelt confident that the leaders of the people, both in the church and in\nthe schools, would gladly unite with him in efforts for reform. Words of\nencouragement from those in high position had inspired him with joy and\nhope. Already in anticipation he had seen a brighter day dawning for the\nchurch. But encouragement had changed to reproach and condemnation. Many\ndignitaries, of both church and state, were convicted of the\ntruthfulness of his theses; but they soon saw that the acceptance of\nthese truths would involve great changes. To enlighten and reform the\npeople would be virtually to undermine the authority of Rome, to stop\nthousands of streams now flowing into her treasury, and thus greatly to\ncurtail the extravagance and luxury of the papal leaders. Furthermore,\nto teach the people to think and act as responsible beings, looking to\nChrist alone for salvation, would overthrow the pontiff's throne and\neventually destroy their own authority. For this reason they refused the\nknowledge tendered them of God and arrayed \u00a0themselves against Christ and\nthe truth by their opposition to the man whom He had sent to enlighten\nthem. \u00a0{GC 131.2}",
                "Luther trembled as he looked upon himself---one man opposed to the\nmightiest powers of earth. He sometimes doubted whether he had indeed\nbeen led of God to set himself against the authority of the church. \"Who\nwas I,\" he writes, \"to oppose the majesty of the pope, before whom \\...\nthe kings of the earth and the whole world trembled? \\... No one can\nknow what my heart suffered during these first two years, and into what\ndespondency, I may say into what despair, I was sunk.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 3,\nch. 6.

                "To a friend of the Reformation Luther wrote: \"We cannot attain to the\nunderstanding of Scripture either by study or by the intellect. Your\nfirst duty is to begin by prayer. Entreat the Lord to grant you, of His\ngreat mercy, the true understanding of His word. There is no other\ninterpreter of the word of God than the Author of this word, as He\nHimself has said, 'They shall be all taught of God.' Hope for nothing\nfrom your own labors, from your own understanding: trust solely in God,\nand in the influence of His Spirit. Believe this on the word of a man\nwho has had experience.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 3, ch. 7. Here is a lesson of\nvital importance to those who feel that God has called them to present\nto others the solemn truths for this time. These truths will stir the\nenmity of Satan and of men who love the fables that he has devised. In\nthe conflict with the powers of evil there is need of something more\nthan strength of intellect and human wisdom. \u00a0{GC 132.2}",
                "When enemies appealed to custom and tradition, or to the assertions and\nauthority of the pope, Luther met them with the Bible and the Bible\nonly. Here were arguments which they could not answer; therefore the\nslaves of formalism and superstition clamored for his blood, as the Jews\nhad clamored for the blood of Christ. \"He is a heretic,\" \u00a0cried the Roman\nzealots. \"It is high treason against the church to allow so horrible a\nheretic to live one hour longer. Let the scaffold be instantly erected\nfor him!\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 3, ch. 9. But Luther did not fall a prey to\ntheir fury. God had a work for him to do, and angels of heaven were sent\nto protect him. Many, however, who had received from Luther the precious\nlight were made the objects of Satan's wrath and for the truth's sake\nfearlessly suffered torture and death. \u00a0{GC 132.3}",
                "Luther's teachings attracted the attention of thoughtful minds\nthroughout all Germany. From his sermons and writings issued beams of\nlight which awakened and illuminated thousands. A living faith was\ntaking the place of the dead formalism in which the church had so long\nbeen held. The people were daily losing confidence in the superstitions\nof Romanism. The barriers of prejudice were giving way. The word of God,\nby which Luther tested every doctrine and every claim, was like a\ntwo-edged sword, cutting its way to the hearts of the people. Everywhere\nthere was awakening a desire for spiritual progress. Everywhere was such\na hungering and thirsting after righteousness as had not been known for\nages. The eyes of the people, so long directed to human rites and\nearthly mediators, were now turning in penitence and faith to Christ and\nHim crucified. \u00a0{GC 133.1}",
                "This widespread interest aroused still further the fears of the papal\nauthorities. Luther received a summons to appear at Rome to answer to\nthe charge of heresy. The command filled his friends with terror. They\nknew full well the danger that threatened him in that corrupt city,\nalready drunk with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. They protested\nagainst his going to Rome and requested that he receive his examination\nin Germany. \u00a0{GC 133.2}",
                "This arrangement was finally effected, and the pope's legate was\nappointed to hear the case.

The legate was therefore charged \"to prosecute and\nconstrain without \u00a0any delay.\" If he should remain steadfast, and the\nlegate should fail to gain possession of his person, he was empowered\n\"to proscribe him in every part of Germany; to banish, curse, and\nexcommunicate all those who are attached to him.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 4, ch.\n2. And, further, the pope directed his legate, in order entirely to root\nout the pestilent heresy, to excommunicate all, of whatever dignity in\nchurch or state, except the emperor, who should neglect to seize Luther\nand his adherents, and deliver them up to the vengeance of Rome. \u00a0{GC\n133.3}",

Luther was at a great distance from Rome; he had had no\nopportunity to explain or defend his position; yet before his case had\nbeen investigated, he was summarily pronounced a heretic, and in the\nsame day, exhorted, accused, judged, and condemned; and all this by the\nself-styled holy father, the only supreme, infallible authority in\nchurch or state! \u00a0{GC 134.1}",
                "At this time, when Luther so much needed the sympathy and counsel of a\ntrue friend, God's providence sent Melanchthon to Wittenberg.

The brilliancy of his talents was not more marked than his\ngentleness of disposition. He soon became an earnest disciple of the\ngospel, and Luther's most trusted friend and valued supporter; his\ngentleness, caution, and exactness serving as a complement to Luther's\ncourage and energy.

They \u00a0even entreated him to leave Wittenberg for a time and find\nsafety with those who would gladly protect him. But he would not leave\nthe position where God had placed him. He must continue faithfully to\nmaintain the truth, notwithstanding the storms that were beating upon\nhim. His language was: \"I am like Jeremiah, a man of strife and\ncontention; but the more their threats increase, the more my joy is\nmultiplied\\.... They have already destroyed my honor and my reputation.\nOne single thing remains; it is my wretched body: let them take it; they\nwill thus shorten my life by a few hours.

The Reformer had failed to provide\nhimself with a safe-conduct. His friends urged him not to appear before\nthe legate without one, and they themselves undertook to procure it from\nthe emperor. The legate intended to force Luther, if possible, to\nretract, or, failing in this, to cause him to be conveyed to Rome, to\nshare the fate of Huss and Jerome. Therefore through his agents he\nendeavored to induce Luther to appear without a safe-conduct, trusting\nhimself to his mercy. This the Reformer firmly declined to do.

He had not rightly estimated the character\nof the man with whom he had to deal. Luther, in reply, expressed his\nregard for the church, his desire for \u00a0the truth, his readiness to answer\nall objections to what he had taught, and to submit his doctrines to the\ndecision of certain leading universities.

I am sure of this, that the word of God is with me, and that it is\nnot with them.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 6, ch. 10. \u00a0{GC 142.3}",
                "Yet it was not without a terrible struggle with himself that Luther\ndecided upon a final separation from the church. It was about this time\nthat he wrote: \"I feel more and more every day how difficult it is to\nlay aside the scruples which one has imbibed in childhood. Oh, how much\npain it has caused me, though I had the Scriptures on my side, to\njustify it to myself that I should dare to make a stand alone against\nthe pope, and hold him forth as antichrist! What have the tribulations\nof my heart not been! How many times have I not asked myself with\nbitterness that question which was so frequent on the lips of the\npapists: 'Art thou alone wise? Can everyone else be mistaken? How will\nit be, if, after all, it is thyself who art wrong, and who art involving\nin thy error so many souls, who will then be eternally damned?' 'Twas so\nI fought with myself and with Satan, till Christ, by His own infallible\nword, fortified my heart against these doubts.\"---Martyn, pages 372,\n373. \u00a0{GC 143.1}",
                "The pope had threatened Luther with excommunication if he did not\nrecant, and the threat was now fulfilled. A new bull appeared, declaring\nthe Reformer's final separation from the Roman Church, denouncing him as\naccursed of Heaven, and including in the same condemnation all who\nshould receive his doctrines. The great contest had been fully entered\nupon. \u00a0{GC 143.2}",
                "Opposition is the lot of all whom God employs to present truths\nspecially applicable to their time. There was a present truth in the\ndays of Luther,---a truth at that time of special importance; there is a\npresent truth for the church today. \u00a0He who does all things according to\nthe counsel of His will has been pleased to place men under various\ncircumstances and to enjoin upon them duties peculiar to the times in\nwhich they live and the conditions under which they are placed. If they\nwould prize the light given them, broader views of truth would be opened\nbefore them. But truth is no more desired by the majority today than it\nwas by the papists who opposed Luther. There is the same disposition to\naccept the theories and traditions of men instead of the word of God as\nin former ages. Those who present the truth for this time should not\nexpect to be received with greater favor than were earlier reformers.\nThe great controversy between truth and error, between Christ and Satan,\nis to increase in intensity to the close of this world's history. \u00a0{GC\n143.3}",
                "Said Jesus to His disciples: \"If ye were of the world, the world would\nlove his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you\nout of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that\nI said unto you, The servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have\npersecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept My\nsaying, they will keep yours also.\" \u00a0John 15:19, 20.

                "A new emperor, Charles V, had ascended the throne of Germany, and the\nemissaries of Rome hastened to present their congratulations and induce\nthe monarch to employ his power against the Reformation. On the other\nhand, the elector of Saxony, to whom Charles was in great degree\nindebted for his crown, entreated him to take no step against Luther\nuntil he should have granted him a hearing. The emperor was thus placed\nin a position of great perplexity and embarrassment. The papists would\nbe satisfied with nothing short of an imperial edict sentencing Luther\nto death. The elector had declared firmly that \"neither his imperial\nmajesty nor any other person had shown that Luther's writings had been\nrefuted;\" therefore he requested \"that Dr. Luther should be furnished\nwith a safe-conduct, so that he might appear before a tribunal of\nlearned, pious, and impartial judges.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 6, ch. 11. \u00a0{GC\n145.1}",
                "The attention of all parties was now directed to the assembly of the\nGerman states which convened at Worms soon after the accession of\nCharles to the empire. There were important political questions and\ninterests to be considered by this national council; for the first time\nthe princes of Germany were to meet their youthful monarch in\ndeliberative assembly. From all parts of the fatherland had come the\ndignitaries of church and state. Secular lords, highborn, powerful, and\njealous of their hereditary rights; princely \u00a0ecclesiastics, flushed with\ntheir conscious superiority in rank and power; courtly knights and their\narmed retainers; and ambassadors from foreign and distant lands,---all\ngathered at Worms. Yet in that vast assembly the subject that excited\nthe deepest interest was the cause of the Saxon Reformer. \u00a0{GC 145.2}",
                "Charles had previously directed the elector to bring Luther with him to\nthe Diet, assuring him of protection, and promising a free discussion,\nwith competent persons, of the questions in dispute. Luther was anxious\nto appear before the emperor. His health was at this time much impaired;\nyet he wrote to the elector: \"If I cannot go to Worms in good health, I\nwill be carried there, sick as I am. For if the emperor calls me, I\ncannot doubt that it is the call of God Himself. If they desire to use\nviolence against me, and that is very probable (for it is not for their\ninstruction that they order me to appear), I place the matter in the\nLord's hands. He still lives and reigns who preserved the three young\nmen in the burning fiery furnace. If He will not save me, my life is of\nlittle consequence. Let us only prevent the gospel from being exposed to\nthe scorn of the wicked, and let us shed our blood for it, for fear they\nshould triumph. It is not for me to decide whether my life or my death\nwill contribute most to the salvation of all\\.... You may expect\neverything from me\\... except flight and recantation. Fly I cannot, and\nstill less retract.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 7, ch. 1. \u00a0{GC 146.1}",
                "As the news was circulated at Worms that Luther was to appear before the\nDiet, a general excitement was created. Aleander, the papal legate to\nwhom the case had been specially entrusted, was alarmed and enraged. He\nsaw that the result would be disastrous to the papal cause. To institute\ninquiry into a case in which the pope had already pronounced sentence of\ncondemnation would be to cast contempt upon the authority of the\nsovereign pontiff. Furthermore, he was apprehensive that the eloquent\nand powerful arguments of this man might turn away many of the princes\nfrom the cause of the pope. He therefore, in the most \u00a0urgent manner,\nremonstrated with Charles against Luther's appearance at Worms. About\nthis time the bull declaring Luther's excommunication was published; and\nthis, coupled with the representations of the legate, induced the\nemperor to yield. He wrote to the elector that if Luther would not\nretract, he must remain at Wittenberg. \u00a0{GC 146.2}",
                "Not content with this victory, Aleander labored with all the power and\ncunning at his command to secure Luther's condemnation. With a\npersistence worthy of a better cause, he urged the matter upon the\nattention of princes, prelates, and other members of the assembly,\naccusing the Reformer of \"sedition, rebellion, impiety, and blasphemy.\"\nBut the vehemence and passion manifested by the legate revealed too\nplainly the spirit by which he was actuated. \"He is moved by hatred and\nvengeance,\" was the general remark, \"much more than by zeal and\npiety.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 7, ch. 1. The majority of the Diet were more than\never inclined to regard Luther's cause with favor. \u00a0{GC 147.1}",
                "With redoubled zeal Aleander urged upon the emperor the duty of\nexecuting the papal edicts. But under the laws of Germany this could not\nbe done without the concurrence of the princes; and, overcome at last by\nthe legate's importunity, Charles bade him present his case to the Diet.\n\"It was a proud day for the nuncio. The assembly was a great one: the\ncause was even greater. Aleander was to plead for Rome, \\... the mother\nand mistress of all churches.\" He was to vindicate the princedom of\nPeter before the assembled principalities of Christendom. \"He had the\ngift of eloquence, and he rose to the greatness of the occasion.\nProvidence ordered it that Rome should appear and plead by the ablest of\nher orators in the presence of the most august of tribunals, before she\nwas condemned.\"---Wylie, b. 6, ch. 4. With some misgivings those who\nfavored the Reformer looked forward to the effect of Aleander's speech.\nThe elector of Saxony was not present, but by his direction some of his\ncouncilors attended to take notes of the nuncio's address. \u00a0{GC 147.2}",
                "With all the power of learning and eloquence, Aleander set himself to\noverthrow the truth. Charge after charge he hurled against Luther as an\nenemy of the church and the state, the living and the dead, clergy and\nlaity, councils and private Christians. \"In Luther's errors there is\nenough,\" he declared, to warrant the burning of \"a hundred thousand\nheretics.\" \u00a0{GC 148.1}",
                "In conclusion he endeavored to cast contempt upon the adherents of the\nreformed faith: \"What are all these Lutherans? A crew of insolent\npedagogues, corrupt priests, dissolute monks, ignorant lawyers, and\ndegraded nobles, with the common people whom they have misled and\nperverted. How far superior to them is the Catholic party in number,\nability, and power! A unanimous decree from this illustrious assembly\nwill enlighten the simple, warn the imprudent, decide the waverers, and\ngive strength to the weak.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 7, ch. 3. \u00a0{GC 148.2}",
                "With such weapons the advocates of truth in every age have been\nattacked. The same arguments are still urged against all who dare to\npresent, in opposition to established errors, the plain and direct\nteachings of God's word. \"Who are these preachers of new doctrines?\"\nexclaim those who desire a popular religion. \"They are unlearned, few in\nnumbers, and of the poorer class. Yet they claim to have the truth, and\nto be the chosen people of God. They are ignorant and deceived. How\ngreatly superior in numbers and influence is our church! How many great\nand learned men are among us! How much more power is on our side!\" These\nare the arguments that have a telling influence upon the world; but they\nare no more conclusive now than in the days of the Reformer. \u00a0{GC 148.3}",
                "The Reformation did not, as many suppose, end with Luther. It is to be\ncontinued to the close of this world's history. Luther had a great work\nto do in reflecting to others the light which God had permitted to shine\nupon him; yet he did not receive all the light which was to be given to\nthe world. From that time to this, new light has been \u00a0continually\nshining upon the Scriptures, and new truths have been constantly\nunfolding. \u00a0{GC 148.4}",
                "The legate's address made a deep impression upon the Diet. There was no\nLuther present, with the clear and convincing truths of God's word, to\nvanquish the papal champion. No attempt was made to defend the Reformer.\nThere was manifest a general disposition not only to condemn him and the\ndoctrines which he taught, but if possible to uproot the heresy. Rome\nhad enjoyed the most favorable opportunity to defend her cause. All that\nshe could say in her own vindication had been said. But the apparent\nvictory was the signal of defeat. Henceforth the contrast between truth\nand error would be more clearly seen, as they should take the field in\nopen warfare. Never from that day would Rome stand as secure as she had\nstood. \u00a0{GC 149.1}",
                "While most of the members of the Diet would not have hesitated to yield\nup Luther to the vengeance of Rome, many of them saw and deplored the\nexisting depravity in the church, and desired a suppression of the\nabuses suffered by the German people in consequence of the corruption\nand greed of the hierarchy. The legate had presented the papal rule in\nthe most favorable light. Now the Lord moved upon a member of the Diet\nto give a true delineation of the effects of papal tyranny. With noble\nfirmness, Duke George of Saxony stood up in that princely assembly and\nspecified with terrible exactness the deceptions and abominations of\npopery, and their dire results. In closing he said: \u00a0{GC 149.2}",
                "\"These are some of the abuses that cry out against Rome.

It is from this foul spring\nthat such tainted waters flow. Debauchery stretches out the hand to\navarice\\.... Alas, it is the scandal caused by the clergy that hurls so\nmany poor souls into eternal condemnation. A general reform must be\neffected.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 7, ch. 4. \u00a0{GC 149.3}",
                "A more able and forcible denunciation of the papal abuses could not have\nbeen presented by Luther himself; and the fact that the speaker was a\ndetermined enemy of the Reformer's gave greater influence to his\nwords. \u00a0{GC 150.1}",
                "Had the eyes of the assembly been opened, they would have beheld angels\nof God in the midst of them, shedding beams of light athwart the\ndarkness of error and opening minds and hearts to the reception of\ntruth. It was the power of the God of truth and wisdom that controlled\neven the adversaries of the reformation, and thus prepared the way for\nthe great work about to be accomplished. Martin Luther was not present;\nbut the voice of One greater than Luther had been heard in that\nassembly. \u00a0{GC 150.2}",
                "A committee was at once appointed by the Diet to prepare an enumeration\nof the papal oppressions that weighed so heavily on the German people.\nThis list, containing a hundred and one specifications, was presented to\nthe emperor, with a request that he would take immediate measures for\nthe correction of these abuses. \"What a loss of Christian souls,\" said\nthe petitioners, \"what depredations, what extortions, on account of the\nscandals by which the spiritual head of Christendom is surrounded! It is\nour duty to prevent the ruin and dishonor of our people. For this reason\nwe most humbly but most urgently entreat you to order a general\nreformation, and to undertake its accomplishment.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 7, ch.\n4. \u00a0{GC 150.3}",
                "The council now demanded the Reformer's appearance before them.\nNotwithstanding the entreaties, protests, and threats of Aleander, the\nemperor at last consented, and Luther was summoned to appear before the\nDiet. With the summons was issued a safe-conduct, ensuring his return to\na place of security. These were borne to Wittenberg by a herald, who was\ncommissioned to conduct him to Worms. \u00a0{GC 150.4}",
                "The friends of Luther were terrified and distressed. Knowing the\nprejudice and enmity against him, they feared that even his safe-conduct\nwould not be respected, and they entreated him not to imperil his life.\nHe replied: \"The papists do not desire my coming to Worms, but\nmy \u00a0condemnation and my death. It matters not. Pray not for me, but for\nthe word of God\\.... Christ will give me His Spirit to overcome these\nministers of error. I despise them during my life; I shall triumph over\nthem by my death. They are busy at Worms about compelling me to retract;\nand this shall be my retraction: I said formerly that the pope was\nChrist's vicar; now I assert that he is our Lord's adversary, and the\ndevil's apostle.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 7, ch. 6. \u00a0{GC 150.5}",
                "Luther was not to make his perilous journey alone. Besides the imperial\nmessenger, three of his firmest friends determined to accompany him.\nMelanchthon earnestly desired to join them. His heart was knit to\nLuther's, and he yearned to follow him, if need be, to prison or to\ndeath. But his entreaties were denied. Should Luther perish, the hopes\nof the Reformation must center upon his youthful colaborer. Said the\nReformer as he parted from Melanchthon: \"If I do not return, and my\nenemies put me to death, continue to teach, and stand fast in the truth.\nLabor in my stead\\.... If you survive, my death will be of little\nconsequence.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 7, ch. 7. Students and citizens who had\ngathered to witness Luther's departure were deeply moved. A multitude\nwhose hearts had been touched by the gospel, bade him farewell with\nweeping. Thus the Reformer and his companions set out from\nWittenberg. \u00a0{GC 151.1}",
                "On the journey they saw that the minds of the people were oppressed by\ngloomy forebodings. At some towns no honors were proffered them. As they\nstopped for the night, a friendly priest expressed his fears by holding\nup before Luther the portrait of an Italian reformer who had suffered\nmartyrdom. The next day they learned that Luther's writings had been\ncondemned at Worms. Imperial messengers were proclaiming the emperor's\ndecree and calling upon the people to bring the proscribed works to the\nmagistrates. The herald, fearing for Luther's safety at the council, and\nthinking that already his resolution might be shaken, asked if he still\nwished to go forward.

                "At Erfurt, Luther was received with honor. Surrounded by admiring\ncrowds, he passed through the streets that he had often traversed with\nhis beggar's wallet. He visited his convent cell, and thought upon the\nstruggles through which the light now flooding Germany had been shed\nupon his soul. He was urged to preach. This he had been forbidden to do,\nbut the herald granted him permission, and the friar who had once been\nmade the drudge of the convent, now entered the pulpit. \u00a0{GC 152.1}",

Luther made no reference to his own\nperilous position. He did not seek to make himself the object of thought\nor sympathy. In the contemplation of Christ he had lost sight of self.\nHe hid behind the Man of Calvary, seeking only to present Jesus as the\nsinner's Redeemer. \u00a0{GC 152.4}",

At the instigation of the papists he was urged to repair to the\ncastle of a friendly knight, where, it was declared, all difficulties\ncould be amicably adjusted. Friends endeavored to excite his fears by\ndescribing the dangers that threatened him.

                "The papists had not believed that Luther would really venture to appear\nat Worms, and his arrival filled them with consternation.

But so great was the desire to\nsee him that he had enjoyed only a few hours' rest when noblemen,\nknights, priests, and citizens gathered eagerly about him. Among these\nwere many of the nobles who had so boldly demanded of the emperor a\nreform of ecclesiastical abuses and who, says Luther, \"had all been\nfreed by my gospel.\"---Martyn, page 393. Enemies, as well as friends,\ncame to look upon the dauntless monk; but he received them with unshaken\ncalmness, replying to all with dignity and wisdom. His bearing was firm\nand courageous.

The titles of the books\nhaving \u00a0been read, Luther replied that as to the first question, he\nacknowledged the books to be his. \"As to the second,\" he said, \"seeing\nthat it is a question which concerns faith and the salvation of souls,\nand in which the word of God, the greatest and most precious treasure\neither in heaven or earth, is involved, I should act imprudently were I\nto reply without reflection. I might affirm less than the circumstance\ndemands, or more than truth requires, and so sin against this saying of\nChrist: 'Whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before\nMy Father which is in heaven.' \\[Matthew 10:33.\\] For this reason I\nentreat your imperial majesty, with all humility, to allow me time, that\nI may answer without offending against the word of God.\"---D'Aubigne, b.\n7, ch. 8. \u00a0{GC 155.3}",
                "In making this request, Luther moved wisely. His course convinced the\nassembly that he did not act from passion or impulse. Such calmness and\nself-command, unexpected in one who had shown himself bold and\nuncompromising, added to his power, and enabled him afterward to answer\nwith a prudence, decision, wisdom, and dignity that surprised and\ndisappointed his adversaries, and rebuked their insolence and pride. \u00a0{GC\n156.1}",
                "The next day he was to appear to render his final answer. For a time his\nheart sank within him as he contemplated the forces that were combined\nagainst the truth. His faith faltered; fearfulness and trembling came\nupon him, and horror overwhelmed him. Dangers multiplied before him; his\nenemies seemed about to triumph, and the powers of darkness to prevail.\nClouds gathered about him and seemed to separate him from God. He longed\nfor the assurance that the Lord of hosts would be with him. In anguish\nof spirit he threw himself with his face upon the earth and poured out\nthose broken, heart-rending cries, which none but God can fully\nunderstand. \u00a0{GC 156.2}",
                "\"O almighty and everlasting God,\" he pleaded, \"how terrible is this\nworld! Behold, it openeth its mouth to swallow me up, and I have so\nlittle trust in Thee\\.... If it is \u00a0only in the strength of this world\nthat I must put my trust, all is over\\.... My last hour is come, my\ncondemnation has been pronounced\\.... O God, do Thou help me against all\nthe wisdom of the world. Do this, \\... Thou alone; \\... for this is not\nmy work, but Thine. I have nothing to do here, nothing to contend for\nwith these great ones of the world\\.... But the cause is Thine, \\... and\nit is a righteous and eternal cause. O Lord, help me! Faithful and\nunchangeable God, in no man do I place my trust\\.... All that is of man\nis uncertain; all that cometh of man fails\\.... Thou hast chosen me for\nthis work\\....

Yet it was not the fear of personal suffering, a dread of\ntorture or death, which seemed immediately impending, that overwhelmed\nhim with its terror. He had come to the crisis, and he felt his\ninsufficiency to meet it. Through his weakness the cause of truth might\nsuffer loss. Not for his own safety, but for the triumph of the gospel\ndid he wrestle with God. Like Israel's, in that night struggle beside\nthe lonely stream, was the anguish and conflict of his soul. Like\nIsrael, he prevailed with God. In his utter helplessness his faith\nfastened upon Christ, the mighty Deliverer. He was strengthened with the\nassurance that he would not appear alone before the council. Peace\nreturned to his soul, and he rejoiced that he was permitted to uplift\nthe word of God before the rulers of the nations. \u00a0{GC 157.1}",

Calm and peaceful, yet grandly\nbrave and noble, he stood as God's witness among the great ones of the\nearth. The imperial officer now demanded his decision as to whether he\ndesired to retract his doctrines. Luther made his answer in a subdued\nand humble tone, without violence or passion.

The second class consisted of writings exposing the\ncorruptions and abuses of the papacy. To revoke these works would\nstrengthen the tyranny of Rome and open a wider door to many and great\nimpieties. In the third class of his books he had attacked individuals\nwho had defended existing evils. Concerning these he freely confessed\nthat he had been more violent than was becoming. He did not claim to be\nfree from fault; but even these books he could not revoke, for such a\ncourse would embolden the enemies of truth, and they would then take\noccasion to crush God's people with still greater cruelty. \u00a0{GC 158.3}",

This is the character,\nthis is the destiny, of the word of God. 'I came not to send peace on\nearth, but a sword,' said Jesus Christ. God is wonderful and terrible in\nHis counsels; beware lest, by presuming to quench dissensions, you\nshould persecute the holy word of God, and draw down upon yourselves a\nfrightful deluge of insurmountable dangers, of present disasters, and\neternal desolation\\....

He had lost sight of himself, and the great men\nsurrounding him, and felt only that he was in the presence of One\ninfinitely superior to popes, prelates, kings, and emperors.

But he could not long\nfind satisfaction in quiet and repose. Accustomed to a life of activity\nand stern conflict, he could ill endure to remain inactive. In those\nsolitary days the condition of the church rose up before him, and \u00a0he\ncried in despair. \"Alas! there is no one in this latter day of His\nanger, to stand like a wall before the Lord, and save\nIsrael!\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 9, ch. 2. Again, his thoughts returned to\nhimself, and he feared being charged with cowardice in withdrawing from\nthe contest. Then he reproached himself for his indolence and\nself-indulgence. Yet at the same time he was daily accomplishing more\nthan it seemed possible for one man to do. His pen was never idle. While\nhis enemies flattered themselves that he was silenced, they were\nastonished and confused by tangible proof that he was still active. A\nhost of tracts, issuing from his pen, circulated throughout Germany. He\nalso performed a most important service for his countrymen by\ntranslating the New Testament into the German tongue. From his rocky\nPatmos he continued for nearly a whole year to proclaim the gospel and\nrebuke the sins and errors of the times. \u00a0{GC 168.3}",
                "But it was not merely to preserve Luther from the wrath of his enemies,\nnor even to afford him a season of quiet for these important labors,\nthat God had withdrawn His servant from the stage of public life. There\nwere results more precious than these to be secured. In the solitude and\nobscurity of his mountain retreat, Luther was removed from earthly\nsupports and shut out from human praise. He was thus saved from the\npride and self-confidence that are so often caused by success. By\nsuffering and humiliation he was prepared again to walk safely upon the\ndizzy heights to which he had been so suddenly exalted. \u00a0{GC 169.1}",
                "As men rejoice in the freedom which the truth brings them, they are\ninclined to extol those whom God has employed to break the chains of\nerror and superstition. Satan seeks to divert men's thoughts and\naffections from God, and to fix them upon human agencies; he leads them\nto honor the mere instrument and to ignore the Hand that directs all the\nevents of providence. Too often religious leaders who are thus praised\nand reverenced lose sight of their dependence upon God and are led to\ntrust in themselves. As \u00a0a result they seek to control the minds and\nconsciences of the people, who are disposed to look to them for guidance\ninstead of looking to the word of God. The work of reform is often\nretarded because of this spirit indulged by its supporters. From this\ndanger, God would guard the cause of the Reformation. He desired that\nwork to receive, not the impress of man, but that of God. The eyes of\nmen had been turned to Luther as the expounder of the truth; he was\nremoved that all eyes might be directed to the eternal Author of\ntruth. \u00a0{GC 169.2}"

                "In the choice of instrumentalities for the reforming of the church, the\nsame divine plan is seen as in that for the planting of the church. The\nheavenly Teacher passed by the great men of the earth, the titled and\nwealthy, who were accustomed to receive praise and homage as leaders of\nthe people. They were so proud and self-confident in their boasted\nsuperiority that they could not be molded to sympathize with their\nfellow men and to become colaborers with the humble Man of Nazareth. To\nthe unlearned, toiling fishermen of Galilee was the call addressed:\n\"Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.\" \u00a0Matthew 4:19. These\ndisciples were humble and teachable. The less they had been influenced\nby the false teaching of their time, the more successfully could Christ\ninstruct and train them for His service. So in the days of the Great\nReformation. The leading Reformers were men from humble life---men who\nwere most free of any of their time from pride of rank and from the\ninfluence of bigotry and priestcraft. It is God's plan to employ humble\ninstruments to accomplish great results. Then the glory will not be\ngiven to men, but to Him who works through them to will and to do of His\nown good pleasure. \u00a0{GC 171.1}",
                "A few weeks after the birth of Luther in a miner's cabin in Saxony,\nUlric Zwingli was born in a herdsman's cottage among the Alps. Zwingli's\nsurroundings in childhood, and \u00a0his early training, were such as to\nprepare him for his future mission. Reared amid scenes of natural\ngrandeur, beauty, and awful sublimity, his mind was early impressed with\na sense of the greatness, the power, and the majesty of God. The history\nof the brave deeds achieved upon his native mountains kindled his\nyouthful aspirations. And at the side of his pious grandmother he\nlistened to the few precious Bible stories which she had gleaned from\namid the legends and traditions of the church. With eager interest he\nheard of the grand deeds of patriarchs and prophets, of the shepherds\nwho watched their flocks on the hills of Palestine where angels talked\nwith them, of the Babe of Bethlehem and the Man of Calvary. \u00a0{GC 171.2}",
                "Like John Luther, Zwingli's father desired an education for his son, and\nthe boy was early sent from his native valley. His mind rapidly\ndeveloped, and it soon became a question where to find teachers\ncompetent to instruct him. At the age of thirteen he went to Bern, which\nthen possessed the most distinguished school in Switzerland. Here,\nhowever, a danger arose which threatened to blight the promise of his\nlife. Determined efforts were put forth by the friars to allure him into\na monastery. The Dominican and Franciscan monks were in rivalry for\npopular favor. This they endeavored to secure by the showy adornments of\ntheir churches, the pomp of their ceremonials, and the attractions of\nfamous relics and miracle-working images. \u00a0{GC 172.1}",
                "The Dominicans of Bern saw that if they could win this talented young\nscholar, they would secure both gain and honor. His extreme youth, his\nnatural ability as a speaker and writer, and his genius for music and\npoetry, would be more effective than all their pomp and display, in\nattracting the people to their services and increasing the revenues of\ntheir order. By deceit and flattery they endeavored to induce Zwingli to\nenter their convent. Luther, while a student at school, had buried\nhimself in a convent cell, and he would have been lost to the world had\nnot God's providence released him. Zwingli was not permitted to\nencounter the \u00a0same peril. Providentially his father received information\nof the designs of the friars. He had no intention of allowing his son to\nfollow the idle and worthless life of the monks. He saw that his future\nusefulness was at stake, and directed him to return home without\ndelay. \u00a0{GC 172.2}",
                "The command was obeyed; but the youth could not be long content in his\nnative valley, and he soon resumed his studies, repairing, after a time,\nto Basel. It was here that Zwingli first heard the gospel of God's free\ngrace. Wittembach, a teacher of the ancient languages, had, while\nstudying Greek and Hebrew, been led to the Holy Scriptures, and thus\nrays of divine light were shed into the minds of the students under his\ninstruction. He declared that there was a truth more ancient, and of\ninfinitely greater worth, than the theories taught by schoolmen and\nphilosophers. This ancient truth was that the death of Christ is the\nsinner's only ransom. To Zwingli these words were as the first ray of\nlight that precedes the dawn. \u00a0{GC 173.1}",
                "Zwingli was soon called from Basel to enter upon his lifework. His first\nfield of labor was in an Alpine parish, not far distant from his native\nvalley. Having received ordination as a priest, he \"devoted himself with\nhis whole soul to the search after divine truth; for he was well aware,\"\nsays a fellow Reformer, \"how much he must know to whom the flock of\nChrist is entrusted.\"---Wylie, b. 8, ch. 5. The more he searched the\nScriptures, the clearer appeared the contrast between their truths and\nthe heresies of Rome. He submitted himself to the Bible as the word of\nGod, the only sufficient, infallible rule. He saw that it must be its\nown interpreter. He dared not attempt to explain Scripture to sustain a\npreconceived theory or doctrine, but held it his duty to learn what is\nits direct and obvious teaching. He sought to avail himself of every\nhelp to obtain a full and correct understanding of its meaning, and he\ninvoked the aid of the Holy Spirit, which would, he declared, reveal it\nto all who sought it in sincerity and with prayer. \u00a0{GC 173.2}",
                "\"The Scriptures,\" said Zwingli, \"come from God, not from man, and even\nthat God who enlightens will give thee to understand that the speech\ncomes from God. The word of God \\... cannot fail; it is bright, it\nteaches itself, it discloses itself, it illumines the soul with all\nsalvation and grace, comforts it in God, humbles it, so that it loses\nand even forfeits itself, and embraces God.\" The truth of these words\nZwingli himself had proved. Speaking of his experience at this time, he\nafterward wrote: \"When \\... I began to give myself wholly up to the Holy\nScriptures, philosophy and theology (scholastic) would always keep\nsuggesting quarrels to me. At last I came to this, that I thought,\n\\`Thou must let all that lie, and learn the meaning of God purely out of\nHis own simple word.' Then I began to ask God for His light, and the\nScriptures began to be much easier to me.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8, ch. 6. \u00a0{GC\n174.1}",
                "The doctrine preached by Zwingli was not received from Luther. It was\nthe doctrine of Christ. \"If Luther preaches Christ,\" said the Swiss\nReformer, \"he does what I am doing. Those whom he has brought to Christ\nare more numerous than those whom I have led. But this matters not. I\nwill bear no other name than that of Christ, whose soldier I am, and who\nalone is my Chief. Never has one single word been written by me to\nLuther, nor by Luther to me. And why? \\... That it might be shown how\nmuch the Spirit of God is in unison with itself, since both of us,\nwithout any collusion, teach the doctrine of Christ with such\nuniformity.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 8, ch. 9. \u00a0{GC 174.2}",
                "In 1516 Zwingli was invited to become a preacher in the convent at\nEinsiedeln. Here he was to have a closer view of the corruptions of Rome\nand was to exert an influence as a Reformer that would be felt far\nbeyond his native Alps. Among the chief attractions of Einsiedeln was an\nimage of the Virgin which was said to have the power of working\nmiracles. Above the gateway of the convent was the inscription, \"Here a\nplenary remission of sins may be \u00a0obtained.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8, ch. 5.\nPilgrims at all seasons resorted to the shrine of the Virgin; but at the\ngreat yearly festival of its consecration multitudes came from all parts\nof Switzerland, and even from France and Germany. Zwingli, greatly\nafflicted at the sight, seized the opportunity to proclaim liberty\nthrough the gospel to these bondslaves of superstition. \u00a0{GC 174.3}",
                "\"Do not imagine,\" he said, \"that God is in this temple more than in any\nother part of creation. Whatever be the country in which you dwell, God\nis around you, and hears you\\.... Can unprofitable works, long\npilgrimages, offerings, images, the invocation of the Virgin or of the\nsaints, secure for you the grace of God? \\... What avails the multitude\nof words with which we embody our prayers? What efficacy has a glossy\ncowl, a smooth-shorn head, a long and flowing robe, or gold-embroidered\nslippers? \\... God looks at the heart, and our hearts are far from Him.\"\n\"Christ,\" he said, \"who was once offered upon the cross, is the\nsacrifice and victim, that had made satisfaction for the sins of\nbelievers to all eternity.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8, ch. 5. \u00a0{GC 175.1}",
                "To many listeners these teachings were unwelcome. It was a bitter\ndisappointment to them to be told that their toilsome journey had been\nmade in vain. The pardon freely offered to them through Christ they\ncould not comprehend. They were satisfied with the old way to heaven\nwhich Rome had marked out for them. They shrank from the perplexity of\nsearching for anything better. It was easier to trust their salvation to\nthe priests and the pope than to seek for purity of heart. \u00a0{GC 175.2}",
                "But another class received with gladness the tidings of redemption\nthrough Christ. The observances enjoined by Rome had failed to bring\npeace of soul, and in faith they accepted the Saviour's blood as their\npropitiation. These returned to their homes to reveal to others the\nprecious light which they had received. The truth was thus carried from\nhamlet to hamlet, from town to town, and the number of pilgrims to the\nVirgin's shrine greatly lessened. There was \u00a0a falling off in the\nofferings, and consequently in the salary of Zwingli, which was drawn\nfrom them. But this caused him only joy as he saw that the power of\nfanaticism and superstition was being broken. \u00a0{GC 175.3}",
                "The authorities of the church were not blind to the work which Zwingli\nwas accomplishing; but for the present they forbore to interfere. Hoping\nyet to secure him to their cause, they endeavored to win him by\nflatteries; and meanwhile the truth was gaining a hold upon the hearts\nof the people. \u00a0{GC 176.1}",
                "Zwingli's labors at Einsiedeln had prepared him for a wider field, and\nthis he was soon to enter. After three years here he was called to the\noffice of preacher in the cathedral at Zurich. This was then the most\nimportant town of the Swiss confederacy, and the influence exerted here\nwould be widely felt. The ecclesiastics by whose invitation he came to\nZurich were, however, desirous of preventing any innovations, and they\naccordingly proceeded to instruct him as to his duties. \u00a0{GC 176.2}",
                "\"You will make every exertion,\" they said, \"to collect the revenues of\nthe chapter, without overlooking the least. You will exhort the\nfaithful, both from the pulpit and in the confessional, to pay all\ntithes and dues, and to show by their offerings their affection to the\nchurch. You will be diligent in increasing the income arising from the\nsick, from masses, and in general from every ecclesiastical ordinance.\"\n\"As for the administration of the sacraments, the preaching, and the\ncare of the flock,\" added his instructors, \"these are also the duties of\nthe chaplain. But for these you may employ a substitute, and\nparticularly in preaching. You should administer the sacraments to none\nbut persons of note, and only when called upon; you are forbidden to do\nso without distinction of persons.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8, ch. 6. \u00a0{GC 176.3}",
                "Zwingli listened in silence to this charge, and in reply, after\nexpressing his gratitude for the honor of a call to this important\nstation, he proceeded to explain the course which \u00a0he proposed to adopt.\n\"The life of Christ,\" he said, \"has been too long hidden from the\npeople. I shall preach upon the whole of the Gospel of St. Matthew, \\...\ndrawing solely from the fountains of Scripture, sounding its depths,\ncomparing one passage with another, and seeking for understanding by\nconstant and earnest prayer. It is to God's glory, to the praise of His\nonly Son, to the real salvation of souls, and to their edification in\nthe true faith, that I shall consecrate my ministry.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8,\nch. 6. Though some of the ecclesiastics disapproved his plan, and\nendeavored to dissuade him from it, Zwingli remained steadfast. He\ndeclared that he was about to introduce no new method, but the old\nmethod employed by the church in earlier and purer times. \u00a0{GC 176.4}",
                "Already an interest had been awakened in the truths he taught; and the\npeople flocked in great numbers to listen to his preaching. Many who had\nlong since ceased to attend service were among his hearers. He began his\nministry by opening the Gospels and reading and explaining to his\nhearers the inspired narrative of the life, teachings, and death of\nChrist. Here, as at Einsiedeln, he presented the word of God as the only\ninfallible authority and the death of Christ as the only complete\nsacrifice. \"It is to Christ,\" he said, \"that I desire to lead you---to\nChrist, the true source of salvation.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8, ch. 6. Around\nthe preacher crowded the people of all classes, from statesmen and\nscholars to the artisan and the peasant. With deep interest they\nlistened to his words. He not only proclaimed the offer of a free\nsalvation, but fearlessly rebuked the evils and corruptions of the\ntimes. Many returned from the cathedral praising God. \"This man,\" they\nsaid, \"is a preacher of the truth. He will be our Moses, to lead us\nforth from this Egyptian darkness.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8, ch. 6. \u00a0{GC 177.1}",
                "But though at first his labors were received with great enthusiasm,\nafter a time opposition arose. The monks set themselves to hinder his\nwork and condemn his teachings. \u00a0Many assailed him with gibes and sneers;\nothers resorted to insolence and threats. But Zwingli bore all with\npatience, saying: \"If we desire to gain over the wicked to Jesus Christ,\nwe must shut our eyes against many things.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8, ch. 6. \u00a0{GC\n177.2}",
                "About this time a new agency came in to advance the work of reform. One\nLucian was sent to Zurich with some of Luther's writings, by a friend of\nthe reformed faith at Basel, who suggested that the sale of these books\nmight be a powerful means of scattering the light. \"Ascertain,\" he wrote\nto Zwingli, \"whether this man possesses sufficient prudence and skill;\nif so, let him carry from city to city, from town to town, from village\nto village, and even from house to house, among the Swiss, the works of\nLuther, and especially his exposition of the Lord's Prayer written for\nthe laity. The more they are known, the more purchasers they will\nfind.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8, ch. 6. Thus the light found entrance. \u00a0{GC 178.1}",
                "At the time when God is preparing to break the shackles of ignorance and\nsuperstition, then it is that Satan works with greatest power to\nenshroud men in darkness and to bind their fetters still more firmly. As\nmen were rising up in different lands to present to the people\nforgiveness and justification through the blood of Christ, Rome\nproceeded with renewed energy to open her market throughout Christendom,\noffering pardon for money. \u00a0{GC 178.2}",
                "Every sin had its price, and men were granted free license for crime if\nthe treasury of the church was kept well filled. Thus the two movements\nadvanced,---one offering forgiveness of sin for money, the other\nforgiveness through Christ,---Rome licensing sin and making it her\nsource of revenue; the Reformers condemning sin and pointing to Christ\nas the propitiation and deliverer. \u00a0{GC 178.3}",
                "In Germany the sale of indulgences had been committed to the Dominican\nfriars and was conducted by the infamous Tetzel. In Switzerland the\ntraffic was put into the hands of the Franciscans, under the control of\nSamson, an Italian \u00a0monk. Samson had already done good service to the\nchurch, having secured immense sums from Germany and Switzerland to fill\nthe papal treasury. Now he traversed Switzerland, attracting great\ncrowds, despoiling the poor peasants of their scanty earnings, and\nexacting rich gifts from the wealthy classes. But the influence of the\nreform already made itself felt in curtailing, though it could not stop,\nthe traffic. Zwingli was still at Einsiedeln when Samson, soon after\nentering Switzerland, arrived with his wares at a neighboring town.\nBeing apprised of his mission, the Reformer immediately set out to\noppose him. The two did not meet, but such was Zwingli's success in\nexposing the friar's pretensions that he was obliged to leave for other\nquarters. \u00a0{GC 178.4}",
                "At Zurich, Zwingli preached zealously against the pardonmongers; and\nwhen Samson approached the place, he was met by a messenger from the\ncouncil with an intimation that he was expected to pass on. He finally\nsecured an entrance by stratagem, but was sent away without the sale of\na single pardon, and he soon after left Switzerland. \u00a0{GC 179.1}",
                "A strong impetus was given to the reform by the appearance of the\nplague, or Great Death, which swept over Switzerland in the year 1519.\nAs men were thus brought face to face with the destroyer, many were led\nto feel how vain and worthless were the pardons which they had so lately\npurchased; and they longed for a surer foundation for their faith.\nZwingli at Zurich was smitten down; he was brought so low that all hope\nof his recovery was relinquished, and the report was widely circulated\nthat he was dead. In that trying hour his hope and courage were\nunshaken. He looked in faith to the cross of Calvary, trusting in the\nall-sufficient propitiation for sin. When he came back from the gates of\ndeath, it was to preach the gospel with greater fervor than ever before;\nand his words exerted an unwonted power. The people welcomed with joy\ntheir beloved pastor, returned to them from the brink of the grave. They\nthemselves had come from attending upon the sick \u00a0and the dying, and they\nfelt, as never before, the value of the gospel. \u00a0{GC 179.2}",
                "Zwingli had arrived at a clearer understanding of its truths, and had\nmore fully experienced in himself its renewing power. The fall of man\nand the plan of redemption were the subjects upon which he dwelt. \"In\nAdam,\" he said, \"we are all dead, sunk in corruption and\ncondemnation.\"---Wylie, b. 8, ch. 9. \"Christ \\... has purchased for us a\nnever-ending redemption\\.... His passion is \\... an eternal sacrifice,\nand everlastingly effectual to heal; it satisfies the divine justice\nforever in behalf of all those who rely upon it with firm and unshaken\nfaith.\" Yet he clearly taught that men are not, because of the grace of\nChrist, free to continue in sin. \"Wherever there is faith in God, there\nGod is; and wherever God abideth, there a zeal exists urging and\nimpelling men to good works.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 8, ch. 9. \u00a0{GC 180.1}",
                "Such was the interest in Zwingli's preaching that the cathedral was\nfilled to overflowing with the crowds that came to listen to him. Little\nby little, as they could bear it, he opened the truth to his hearers. He\nwas careful not to introduce, at first, points which would startle them\nand create prejudice. His work was to win their hearts to the teachings\nof Christ, to soften them by His love, and keep before them His example;\nand as they should receive the principles of the gospel, their\nsuperstitious beliefs and practices would inevitably be overthrown. \u00a0{GC\n180.2}",
                "Step by step the Reformation advanced in Zurich. In alarm its enemies\naroused to active opposition. One year before, the monk of Wittenberg\nhad uttered his No to the pope and the emperor at Worms, and now\neverything seemed to indicate a similar withstanding of the papal claims\nat Zurich. Repeated attacks were made upon Zwingli. In the papal\ncantons, from time to time, disciples of the gospel were brought to the\nstake, but this was not enough; the teacher of heresy must be silenced.\nAccordingly the bishop of Constance dispatched three deputies to the\nCouncil of Zurich, accusing Zwingli of teaching the people to \u00a0transgress\nthe laws of the church, thus endangering the peace and good order of\nsociety. If the authority of the church were to be set aside, he urged,\nuniversal anarchy would result. Zwingli replied that he had been for\nfour years teaching the gospel in Zurich, \"which was more quiet and\npeaceful than any other town in the confederacy.\" \"Is not, then,\" he\nsaid, \"Christianity the best safeguard of the general\nsecurity?\"---Wylie, b. 8, ch. 11. \u00a0{GC 180.3}",
                "The deputies had admonished the councilors to continue in the church,\nout of which, they declared, there was no salvation. Zwingli responded:\n\"Let not this accusation move you. The foundation of the church is the\nsame Rock, the same Christ, that gave Peter his name because he\nconfessed Him faithfully. In every nation whosoever believes with all\nhis heart in the Lord Jesus is accepted of God. Here, truly, is the\nchurch, out of which no one can be saved.\"---D'Aubigne, London ed., b.\n8, ch. 11. As a result of the conference, one of the bishop's deputies\naccepted the reformed faith. \u00a0{GC 181.1}",
                "The council declined to take action against Zwingli, and Rome prepared\nfor a fresh attack. The Reformer, when apprised of the plots of his\nenemies, exclaimed: \"Let them come on; I fear them as the beetling cliff\nfears the waves that thunder at its feet.\"---Wylie, b. 8, ch. 11. The\nefforts of the ecclesiastics only furthered the cause which they sought\nto overthrow. The truth continued to spread. In Germany its adherents,\ncast down by Luther's disappearance, took heart again, as they saw the\nprogress of the gospel in Switzerland. \u00a0{GC 181.2}",
                "As the Reformation became established in Zurich, its fruits were more\nfully seen in the suppression of vice and the promotion of order and\nharmony. \"Peace has her habitation in our town,\" wrote Zwingli; \"no\nquarrel, no hypocrisy, no envy, no strife. Whence can such union come\nbut from the Lord, and our doctrine, which fills us with the fruits of\npeace and piety?\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 8, ch. 15. \u00a0{GC 181.3}",
                "The victories gained by the Reformation stirred the Romanists to still\nmore determined efforts for its overthrow. \u00a0Seeing how little had been\naccomplished by persecution in suppressing Luther's work in Germany,\nthey decided to meet the reform with its own weapons. They would hold a\ndisputation with Zwingli, and having the arrangement of matters, they\nwould make sure of victory by choosing, themselves, not only the place\nof the combat, but the judges that should decide between the disputants.\nAnd if they could once get Zwingli into their power, they would take\ncare that he did not escape them. The leader silenced, the movement\ncould speedily be crushed. This purpose, however, was carefully\nconcealed. \u00a0{GC 181.4}",
                "The disputation was appointed to be held at Baden; but Zwingli was not\npresent. The Council of Zurich, suspecting the designs of the papists,\nand warned by the burning piles kindled in the papal cantons for\nconfessors of the gospel, forbade their pastor to expose himself to this\nperil. At Zurich he was ready to meet all the partisans that Rome might\nsend; but to go to Baden, where the blood of martyrs for the truth had\njust been shed, was to go to certain death. Oecolampadius and Haller\nwere chosen to represent the Reformers, while the famous Dr. Eck,\nsupported by a host of learned doctors and prelates, was the champion of\nRome. \u00a0{GC 182.1}",
                "Though Zwingli was not present at the conference, his influence was\nfelt. The secretaries were all chosen by the papists, and others were\nforbidden to take notes, on pain of death. Notwithstanding this, Zwingli\nreceived daily a faithful account of what was said at Baden. A student\nin attendance at the disputation made a record each evening of the\narguments that day presented.

                "One of the noblest testimonies ever uttered for the Reformation was the\nProtest offered by the Christian princes of Germany at the Diet of\nSpires in 1529. The courage, faith, and firmness of those men of God\ngained for succeeding ages liberty of thought and of conscience. Their\nProtest gave to the reformed church the name of Protestant; its\nprinciples are \"the very essence of Protestantism.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 13,\nch. 6. \u00a0{GC 197.1}",
                "A dark and threatening day had come for the Reformation. Notwithstanding\nthe Edict of Worms, declaring Luther to be an outlaw and forbidding the\nteaching or belief of his doctrines, religious toleration had thus far\nprevailed in the empire. God's providence had held in check the forces\nthat opposed the truth. Charles V was bent on crushing the Reformation,\nbut often as he raised his hand to strike he had been forced to turn\naside the blow. Again and again the immediate destruction of all who\ndared to oppose themselves to Rome appeared inevitable; but at the\ncritical moment the armies of the Turk appeared on the eastern frontier,\nor the king of France, or even the pope himself, jealous of the\nincreasing greatness of the emperor, made war upon him; and thus, amid\nthe strife and tumult of nations, the Reformation had been left to\nstrengthen and extend. \u00a0{GC 197.2}",
                "At last, however, the papal sovereigns had stifled their feuds, that\nthey might make common cause against the Reformers. The Diet of Spires\nin 1526 had given each state full liberty in matters of religion until\nthe meeting of a general \u00a0council; but no sooner had the dangers passed\nwhich secured this concession, than the emperor summoned a second Diet\nto convene at Spires in 1529 for the purpose of crushing heresy. The\nprinces were to be induced, by peaceable means if possible, to side\nagainst the Reformation; but if these failed, Charles was prepared to\nresort to the sword. \u00a0{GC 197.3}",
                "The papists were exultant. They appeared at Spires in great numbers, and\nopenly manifested their hostility toward the Reformers and all who\nfavored them. Said Melanchthon: \"We are the execration and the sweepings\nof the world; but Christ will look down on His poor people, and will\npreserve them.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 13, ch. 5. The evangelical princes in\nattendance at the Diet were forbidden even to have the gospel preached\nin their dwellings. But the people of Spires thirsted for the word of\nGod, and, notwithstanding the prohibition, thousands flocked to the\nservices held in the chapel of the elector of Saxony. \u00a0{GC 198.1}",
                "This hastened the crisis. An imperial message announced to the Diet that\nas the resolution granting liberty of conscience had given rise to great\ndisorders, the emperor required that it be annulled. This arbitrary act\nexcited the indignation and alarm of the evangelical Christians. Said\none: \"Christ has again fallen into the hands of Caiaphas and Pilate.\"\nThe Romanists became more violent. A bigoted papist declared: \"The Turks\nare better than the Lutherans; for the Turks observe fast days, and the\nLutherans violate them. If we must choose between the Holy Scriptures of\nGod and the old errors of the church, we should reject the former.\" Said\nMelanchthon: \"Every day, in full assembly, Faber casts some new stone at\nus gospelers.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 13, ch. 5. \u00a0{GC 198.2}",

Luther,\nbeing still under the ban imposed by the Edict of Worms, was not\npermitted to be present at Spires; but his place was supplied by his\ncolaborers and the princes whom God had raised up to defend His cause in\nthis emergency. The noble Frederick of Saxony, Luther's \u00a0former\nprotector, had been removed by death; but Duke John, his brother and\nsuccessor, had joyfully welcomed the Reformation, and while a friend of\npeace, he displayed great energy and courage in all matters relating to\nthe interests of the faith. \u00a0{GC 198.3}",
                "The priests demanded that the states which had accepted the Reformation\nsubmit implicitly to Romish jurisdiction.

                "As a compromise it was finally proposed that where the Reformation had\nnot become established, the Edict of Worms should be rigorously\nenforced; and that \"in those where the people had deviated from it, and\nwhere they could not conform to it without danger of revolt, they should\nat least effect no new reform, they should touch upon no controverted\npoint, they should not oppose the celebration of the mass, they should\npermit no Roman Catholic to embrace Lutheranism.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 13, ch.\n5.

No conversions would be allowed.\nAnd to these restrictions and prohibitions the friends of the\nReformation were required at once to submit. The hopes of the world\nseemed about to be extinguished. \"The re-establishment of the Romish\nhierarchy \\... would infallibly bring back the ancient abuses;\" and an\noccasion would readily be found for \"completing the destruction of a\nwork already so violently shaken\" by fanaticism and\ndissension.---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 13, ch. 5. \u00a0{GC 199.3}",
                "As the evangelical party met for consultation, one looked to another in\nblank dismay.

How easily might the\nReformers at this crisis, which was truly a tremendous one, have argued\nthemselves into a wrong course! How many plausible pretexts and fair\nreasons might they have found for submission! The Lutheran princes were\nguaranteed the free exercise of their religion. The same boon was\nextended to all those of their subjects who, prior to the passing of the\nmeasure, had embraced the reformed views. Ought not this to content\nthem? How many perils would submission avoid! On what unknown hazards\nand conflicts would opposition launch them! Who knows what opportunities\nthe future may bring? Let us embrace peace; let us seize the olive\nbranch Rome holds out, and close the wounds of Germany.

As to all outside that arrangement, the great principle of\nauthority was to rule; conscience was out of court; Rome was infallible\njudge, and must be obeyed. The acceptance of the proposed arrangement\nwould have been a virtual admission that religious liberty ought to be\nconfined to reformed Saxony; and as to all the rest of Christendom, free\ninquiry and the profession of the reformed faith were crimes, and must\nbe visited with the dungeon and the stake. Could they consent to\nlocalize religious liberty? to have it proclaimed that the Reformation\nhad made its last convert? had subjugated its last acre? and that\nwherever Rome bore sway at this hour, there her dominion was to be\nperpetuated?

The representatives of the free cities were at last summoned\nbefore the Diet and required to declare whether they would accede to the\nterms of the proposition. They pleaded for delay, but in vain. When\nbrought to the test, nearly one half their number sided with the\nReformers. Those who thus refused to sacrifice liberty of conscience and\nthe right of individual judgment well knew that their position marked\nthem for future criticism, condemnation, and persecution.

He \"begged the princes to accept the decree, \u00a0assuring\nthem that the emperor would be exceedingly pleased with them.\" But these\nfaithful men acknowledged an authority above that of earthly rulers, and\nthey answered calmly: \"We will obey the emperor in everything that may\ncontribute to maintain peace and the honor of God.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 13,\nch. 5. \u00a0{GC 201.3}",

Now this Protest opposes two abuses of\nman in matters of faith: the first is \u00a0the intrusion of the civil\nmagistrate, and the second the arbitrary authority of the church.\nInstead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience\nabove the magistrate, and the authority of the word of God above the\nvisible church. In the first place, it rejects the civil power in divine\nthings, and says with the prophets and apostles, \u00a0*'We must obey God\nrather than man.'* \u00a0In presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it\nuplifts the crown of Jesus Christ.

                "When powerful foes were uniting to overthrow the reformed faith, and\nthousands of swords seemed about to be unsheathed against it, Luther\nwrote: \"Satan is putting forth his fury; ungodly pontiffs are\nconspiring; and we are threatened with war. Exhort the people to contend\nvaliantly before the throne of the Lord, by faith and prayer, so that\nour enemies, vanquished by the Spirit of God, may be constrained to\npeace. Our chief want, our chief labor, is prayer; let the people know\nthat they are now exposed to the edge of the sword and to the rage of\nSatan, and let them pray.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 10, ch. 14. \u00a0{GC 209.2}",
                "Again, at a later date, referring to the league contemplated by the\nreformed princes, Luther declared that the only weapon employed in this\nwarfare should be \"the sword of the Spirit.\" He wrote to the elector of\nSaxony: \"We cannot on our conscience approve the proposed alliance. We\nwould rather die ten times than see our gospel cause one drop of blood\nto be shed. Our part is to be like lambs of the slaughter. The cross of\nChrist must be borne. Let your highness be without fear. We shall do\nmore by our prayers than all our enemies by their boastings. Only let\nnot your hands be stained with the blood of your brethren. If the\nemperor requires us to be given up to his tribunals, we are ready to\nappear. You cannot defend our faith: each one should believe at his own\nrisk and peril.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 14, ch. 1. \u00a0{GC 209.3}",

There, with holy calmness, the servants of the\nLord set their feet upon the rock of His promises. During the struggle\nat Augsburg, Luther \"did not pass a day without devoting three hours at\nleast to prayer, and they were hours selected from those the most\nfavorable to study.\" In the privacy of his chamber he was heard to pour\nout his soul before God in words \"full of adoration, fear, and hope, as\nwhen one speaks to a friend.\" \"I know that Thou art our Father and our\nGod,\" he said, \"and that Thou wilt scatter the persecutors of Thy\nchildren; for Thou art Thyself endangered with us. All this matter is\nThine, and it is only by Thy constraint that we have put our hands to\nit. Defend us, then, O Father!\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 14, ch. 6. \u00a0{GC 210.1}",

Weakened by divisions among its supporters, and\nassailed by powerful foes, Protestantism seemed destined to be utterly\ndestroyed. Thousands sealed their testimony with their blood. Civil war\nbroke out; the Protestant cause was betrayed by one of its leading\nadherents; the noblest of the reformed princes fell into the hands of\nthe emperor and were dragged as captives from town to town. But in the\nmoment of his apparent triumph, the emperor was smitten with defeat. He\nsaw the prey wrested from his grasp, and he was forced at last to grant\ntoleration to the doctrines which it had been the ambition of his life\nto destroy. He had staked his kingdom, his treasures, and life itself\nupon the crushing out of the heresy. Now he saw his armies wasted by\nbattle, his treasuries drained, his many kingdoms threatened by revolt,\nwhile everywhere the faith which he had vainly endeavored to suppress,\nwas extending. Charles V had been battling against omnipotent power. God\nhad said, \"Let there be light,\" but the emperor had sought to keep the\ndarkness unbroken. His purposes had failed; and in premature old age,\nworn out with the long struggle, he abdicated the throne and buried\nhimself in a cloister. \u00a0{GC 211.1}",
                "In Switzerland, as in Germany, there came dark days for the Reformation.\nWhile many cantons accepted the reformed \u00a0faith, others clung with blind\npersistence to the creed of Rome. Their persecution of those who desired\nto receive the truth finally gave rise to civil war. Zwingli and many\nwho had united with him in reform fell on the bloody field of Cappel.\nOecolampadius, overcome by these terrible disasters, soon after died.\nRome was triumphant, and in many places seemed about to recover all that\nshe had lost. But He whose counsels are from everlasting had not\nforsaken His cause or His people. His hand would bring deliverance for\nthem. In other lands He had raised up laborers to carry forward the\nreform. \u00a0{GC 211.2}",
                "In France, before the name of Luther had been heard as a Reformer, the\nday had already begun to break. One of the first to catch the light was\nthe aged Lefevre, a man of extensive learning, a professor in the\nUniversity of Paris, and a sincere and zealous papist. In his researches\ninto ancient literature his attention was directed to the Bible, and he\nintroduced its study among his students. \u00a0{GC 212.1}",
                "Lefevre was an enthusiastic adorer of the saints, and he had undertaken\nto prepare a history of the saints and martyrs as given in the legends\nof the church. This was a work which involved great labor; but he had\nalready made considerable progress in it, when, thinking that he might\nobtain useful assistance from the Bible, he began its study with this\nobject. Here indeed he found saints brought to view, but not such as\nfigured in the Roman calendar. A flood of divine light broke in upon his\nmind. In amazement and disgust he turned away from his self-appointed\ntask and devoted himself to the word of God. The precious truths which\nhe there discovered he soon began to teach. \u00a0{GC 212.2}",
                "In 1512, before either Luther or Zwingli had begun the work of reform,\nLefevre wrote: \"It is God who gives us, by faith, that righteousness\nwhich by grace alone justifies to eternal life.\"---Wylie, b. 13, ch. 1.\nDwelling upon the mysteries of redemption, he exclaimed: \"Oh, the\nunspeakable greatness of that exchange,---the Sinless One is\ncondemned, \u00a0and he who is guilty goes free; the Blessing bears the curse,\nand the cursed is brought into blessing; the Life dies, and the dead\nlive; the Glory is whelmed in darkness, and he who knew nothing but\nconfusion of face is clothed with glory.\"---D'Aubigne, London ed., b.\n12, ch. 2. \u00a0{GC 212.3}",
                "And while teaching that the glory of salvation belongs solely to God, he\nalso declared that the duty of obedience belongs to man. \"If thou art a\nmember of Christ's church,\" he said, \"thou art a member of His body; if\nthou art of His body, then thou art full of the divine nature\\.... Oh,\nif men could but enter into the understanding of this privilege, how\npurely, chastely, and holily would they live, and how contemptible, when\ncompared with the glory within them,---that glory which the eye of flesh\ncannot see,---would they deem all the glory of this\nworld.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 12, ch. 2. \u00a0{GC 213.1}",
                "There were some among Lefevre's students who listened eagerly to his\nwords, and who, long after the teacher's voice should be silenced, were\nto continue to declare the truth. Such was William Farel. The son of\npious parents, and educated to accept with implicit faith the teachings\nof the church, he might, with the apostle Paul, have declared concerning\nhimself: \"After the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a\nPharisee.\" \u00a0Acts 26:5. A devoted Romanist, he burned with zeal to destroy\nall who should dare to oppose the church. \"I would gnash my teeth like a\nfurious wolf,\" he afterward said, referring to this period of his life,\n\"when I heard anyone speaking against the pope.\"---Wylie, b. 13, ch. 2.\nHe had been untiring in his adoration of the saints, in company with\nLefevre making the round of the churches of Paris, worshipping at the\naltars, and adorning with gifts the holy shrines. But these observances\ncould not bring peace of soul. Conviction of sin fastened upon him,\nwhich all the acts of penance that he practiced failed to banish. As to\na voice from heaven he listened to the Reformer's words: \"Salvation is\nof grace.\" \"The Innocent One is condemned, and the criminal is\nacquitted.\" \"It is the cross of Christ alone that \u00a0openeth the gates of\nheaven, and shutteth the gates of hell.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 13, ch. 2. \u00a0{GC\n213.2}",
                "Farel joyfully accepted the truth. By a conversion like that of Paul he\nturned from the bondage of tradition to the liberty of the sons of God.\n\"Instead of the murderous heart of a ravening wolf,\" he came back, he\nsays, \"quietly like a meek and harmless lamb, having his heart entirely\nwithdrawn from the pope, and given to Jesus Christ.\"---D'Aubigne, b. 12,\nch. 3. \u00a0{GC 214.1}",
                "While Lefevre continued to spread the light among his students, Farel,\nas zealous in the cause of Christ as he had been in that of the pope,\nwent forth to declare the truth in public. A dignitary of the church,\nthe bishop of Meaux, soon after united with them. Other teachers who\nranked high for their ability and learning joined in proclaiming the\ngospel, and it won adherents among all classes, from the homes of\nartisans and peasants to the palace of the king. The sister of Francis\nI, then the reigning monarch, accepted the reformed faith. The king\nhimself, and the queen mother, appeared for a time to regard it with\nfavor, and with high hopes the Reformers looked forward to the time when\nFrance should be won to the gospel. \u00a0{GC 214.2}",
                "But their hopes were not to be realized. Trial and persecution awaited\nthe disciples of Christ. This, however, was mercifully veiled from their\neyes. A time of peace intervened, that they might gain strength to meet\nthe tempest; and the Reformation made rapid progress. The bishop of\nMeaux labored zealously in his own diocese to instruct both the clergy\nand the people. Ignorant and immoral priests were removed, and, so far\nas possible, replaced by men of learning and piety. The bishop greatly\ndesired that his people might have access to the word of God for\nthemselves, and this was soon accomplished. Lefevre undertook the\ntranslation of the New Testament; and at the very time when Luther's\nGerman Bible was issuing from the press in Wittenberg, the French New\nTestament was published at Meaux. The bishop spared no labor or expense\nto circulate it in his parishes, and soon the \u00a0peasants of Meaux were in\npossession of the Holy Scriptures. \u00a0{GC 214.3}",
                "As travelers perishing from thirst welcome with joy a living water\nspring, so did these souls receive the message of heaven. The laborers\nin the field, the artisans in the workshop, cheered their daily toil by\ntalking of the precious truths of the Bible. At evening, instead of\nresorting to the wine-shops, they assembled in one another's homes to\nread God's word and join in prayer and praise. A great change was soon\nmanifest in these communities. Though belonging to the humblest class,\nan unlearned and hard-working peasantry, the reforming, uplifting power\nof divine grace was seen in their lives. Humble, loving, and holy, they\nstood as witnesses to what the gospel will accomplish for those who\nreceive it in sincerity. \u00a0{GC 215.1}",
                "The light kindled at Meaux shed its beams afar. Every day the number of\nconverts was increasing. The rage of the hierarchy was for a time held\nin check by the king, who despised the narrow bigotry of the monks; but\nthe papal leaders finally prevailed. Now the stake was set up. The\nbishop of Meaux, forced to choose between the fire and recantation,\naccepted the easier path; but notwithstanding the leader's fall, his\nflock remained steadfast. Many witnessed for the truth amid the flames.\nBy their courage and fidelity at the stake, these humble Christians\nspoke to thousands who in days of peace had never heard their\ntestimony. \u00a0{GC 215.2}",
                "It was not alone the humble and the poor that amid suffering and scorn\ndared to bear witness for Christ. In the lordly halls of the castle and\nthe palace there were kingly souls by whom truth was valued above wealth\nor rank or even life. Kingly armor concealed a loftier and more\nsteadfast spirit than did the bishop's robe and miter. Louis de Berquin\nwas of noble birth. A brave and courtly knight, he was devoted to study,\npolished in manners, and of blameless morals. \"He was,\" says a writer,\n\"a great follower of the papistical constitutions, and a great hearer of\nmasses and sermons; \\... and he crowned all his other virtues by holding\nLutheranism in \u00a0special abhorrence.\" But, like so many others,\nprovidentially guided to the Bible, he was amazed to find there, \"not\nthe doctrines of Rome, but the doctrines of Luther.\"---Wylie, b. 13, ch.\n9.

                "\"The most learned of the nobles of France,\" his genius and eloquence,\nhis indomitable courage and heroic zeal, and his influence at\ncourt,---for he was a favorite with the king,---caused him to be\nregarded by many as one destined to be the Reformer of his country. Said\nBeza: \"Berquin would have been a second Luther, had he found in Francis\nI a second elector.\" \"He is worse than Luther,\" cried the\npapists.---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 13, ch. 9. More dreaded he was indeed by the\nRomanists of France. They thrust him into prison as a heretic, but he\nwas set at liberty by the king. For years the struggle continued.\nFrancis, wavering between Rome and the Reformation, alternately\ntolerated and restrained the fierce zeal of the monks. Berquin was three\ntimes imprisoned by the papal authorities, only to be released by the\nmonarch, who, in admiration of his genius and his nobility of character,\nrefused to sacrifice him to the malice of the hierarchy. \u00a0{GC 216.1}",
                "Berquin was repeatedly warned of the danger that threatened him in\nFrance, and urged to follow the steps of those who had found safety in\nvoluntary exile. The timid and time-serving Erasmus, who with all the\nsplendor of his scholarship failed of that moral greatness which holds\nlife and honor subservient to truth, wrote to Berquin: \"Ask to be sent\nas ambassador to some foreign country; go and travel in Germany. You\nknow Beda and such as he---he is a thousand-headed monster, darting\nvenom on every side. Your enemies are named legion. Were your cause\nbetter than that of Jesus Christ, they will not let you go till they\nhave miserably destroyed you. Do not trust too much to the king's\nprotection. At all events, \u00a0*do not compromise me* \u00a0with the faculty of\ntheology.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 13, ch. 9. \u00a0{GC 216.2}",
                "But as dangers thickened, Berquin's zeal only waxed the stronger. So far\nfrom adopting the politic and self-serving \u00a0counsel of Erasmus, he\ndetermined upon still bolder measures. He would not only stand in\ndefense of the truth, but he would attack error. The charge of heresy\nwhich the Romanists were seeking to fasten upon him, he would rivet upon\nthem. The most active and bitter of his opponents were the learned\ndoctors and monks of the theological department in the great University\nof Paris, one of the highest ecclesiastical authorities both in the city\nand the nation. From the writings of these doctors, Berquin drew twelve\npropositions which he publicly declared to be \"opposed to the Bible, and\nheretical;\" and he appealed to the king to act as judge in the\ncontroversy. \u00a0{GC 216.3}",
                "The monarch, not loath to bring into contrast the power and acuteness of\nthe opposing champions, and glad of an opportunity of humbling the pride\nof these haughty monks, bade the Romanists defend their cause by the\nBible. This weapon, they well knew, would avail them little;\nimprisonment, torture, and the stake were arms which they better\nunderstood how to wield. Now the tables were turned, and they saw\nthemselves about to fall into the pit into which they had hoped to\nplunge Berquin. In amazement they looked about them for some way of\nescape. \u00a0{GC 217.1}",
                "\"Just at that time an image of the Virgin at the corner of one of the\nstreets, was mutilated.\" There was great excitement in the city. Crowds\nof people flocked to the place, with expressions of mourning and\nindignation. The king also was deeply moved. Here was an advantage which\nthe monks could turn to good account, and they were quick to improve it.\n\"These are the fruits of the doctrines of Berquin,\" they cried. \"All is\nabout to be overthrown---religion, the laws, the throne itself---by this\nLutheran conspiracy.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0b. 13, ch. 9. \u00a0{GC 217.2}",

An immense throng\ngathered to witness the event, and there were many who saw with\nastonishment and misgiving that the victim had been chosen from the best\nand bravest of the noble families of France. Amazement, indignation,\nscorn, and bitter hatred darkened the faces of that surging crowd; but\nupon one face no shadow rested.

Surrounded by the members of the household, he\nread the Bible and opened the truths of salvation. Those who heard the\nmessage carried the good news to others, and soon the teacher passed\nbeyond the city to the outlying towns and hamlets. To both the castle\nand the cabin he found entrance, and he went forward, laying the\nfoundation of churches that were to yield fearless witnesses for the\ntruth. \u00a0{GC 221.4}",

The study of the ancient\nlanguages had led men to the Bible, and many whose hearts were untouched\nby its truths were eagerly discussing them and even giving battle to the\nchampions of Romanism. Calvin, though an able combatant in the fields of\ntheological controversy, had a higher mission to accomplish than that of\nthese noisy schoolmen. The minds of men were stirred, and now was the\ntime to open to them the truth.

The\nking, influenced by political considerations, had not yet fully sided\nwith Rome against the Reformation. Margaret still clung to the hope that\nProtestantism was to triumph in France. She resolved that the reformed\nfaith should be preached in Paris. During the absence of the king, she\nordered a Protestant minister to preach in the churches of the city.\nThis being forbidden by the papal dignitaries, the princess threw open\nthe palace. An apartment was fitted up as a chapel, and it was announced\nthat every day, at a specified hour, a sermon would be preached, and the\npeople of every rank and station were invited to attend. \u00a0Crowds flocked\nto the service. Not only the chapel, but the antechambers and halls were\nthronged. Thousands every day assembled---nobles, statesmen, lawyers,\nmerchants, and artisans. The king, instead of forbidding the assemblies,\nordered that two of the churches of Paris should be opened. Never before\nhad the city been so moved by the word of God. The spirit of life from\nheaven seemed to be breathed upon the people.

For two years\nthe word of God was preached in the capital; but, while there were many\nwho accepted the gospel, the majority of the people rejected it.

Traveling southward, he\nagain found refuge in the dominions of Margaret. (See\nD'Aubigne, \u00a0*History of the Reformation in Europe in the Time of\nCalvin,* \u00a0b. 2, ch. 30.) \u00a0{GC 223.2}",

Persons of all classes gladly listened to the gospel. There\nwas no public preaching, but in the home of the chief magistrate, in his\nown lodgings, and sometimes in a public garden, Calvin opened the words\nof eternal life to those who desired to listen. After a time, as the\nnumber of hearers increased, it was thought safer to assemble outside\nthe city. A cave in the side of a deep and narrow gorge, where trees and\noverhanging rocks made the seclusion still more complete, was chosen as\nthe place of meeting.

                "These monstrous doctrines are essentially the same as the later teaching\nof popular educators and theologians---that there is no unchangeable\ndivine law as the standard of right, but that the standard of morality\nis indicated by society itself, and has constantly been subject to\nchange. All these ideas are inspired by the same master spirit---by him\nwho, even among the sinless inhabitants of heaven, began his work of\nseeking to break down the righteous restraints of the law of God. \u00a0{GC\n261.2}",
                "The doctrine of the divine decrees, unalterably fixing the character of\nmen, had led many to a virtual rejection of the law of God. Wesley\nsteadfastly opposed the errors of the antinomian teachers and showed\nthat this doctrine which led to antinomianism was contrary to the\nScriptures. \"The grace \u00a0of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared\nto \u00a0*all men*.\" \"This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our\nSaviour; who will have \u00a0*all men* \u00a0to be saved, and to come unto the\nknowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between\nGod and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave Himself a ransom\nfor \u00a0*all*.\" \u00a0Titus 2:11; \u00a01 Timothy 2:3-6. The Spirit of God is freely\nbestowed to enable every man to lay hold upon the means of salvation.\nThus Christ, \"the true Light,\" \"lighteth every man that cometh into the\nworld.\" \u00a0John 1:9. Men fail of salvation through their own willful\nrefusal of the gift of life. \u00a0{GC 261.3}",
                "In answer to the claim that at the death of Christ the precepts of the\nDecalogue had been abolished with the ceremonial law, Wesley said: \"The\nmoral law, contained in the Ten Commandments and enforced by the\nprophets, He did not take away. It was not the design of His coming to\nrevoke any part of this. This is a law which never can be broken, which\n'stands fast as the faithful witness in heaven.' \\... This was from the\nbeginning of the world, being 'written not on tables of stone,' but on\nthe hearts of all the children of men, when they came out of the hands\nof the Creator. And however the letters once wrote by the finger of God\nare now in a great measure defaced by sin, yet can they not wholly be\nblotted out, while we have any consciousness of good and evil. Every\npart of this law must remain in force upon all mankind, and in all ages;\nas not depending either on time or place, or any other circumstances\nliable to change, but on the nature of God, and the nature of man, and\ntheir unchangeable relation to each other. \u00a0{GC 262.1}",
                "\"'I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.' \\... Without question, His\nmeaning in this place is (consistently with all that goes before and\nfollows after),---I am come to establish it in its fullness, in spite of\nall the glosses of men: I am come to place in a full and clear view\nwhatsoever was dark or obscure therein: I am come to declare the true\nand full import of every part of it; to show the length and breadth, the\nentire extent, of every commandment contained therein, and the \u00a0height\nand depth, the inconceivable purity and spirituality of it in all its\nbranches.\"---Wesley, sermon 25. \u00a0{GC 262.2}",
                "Wesley declared the perfect harmony of the law and the gospel. \"There\nis, therefore, the closest connection that can be conceived, between the\nlaw and the gospel. On the one hand, the law continually makes way for,\nand points us to, the gospel; on the other, the gospel continually leads\nus to a more exact fulfilling of the law. The law, for instance,\nrequires us to love God, to love our neighbor, to be meek, humble, or\nholy. We feel that we are not sufficient for these things; yea, that\n'with man this is impossible;' but we see a promise of God to give us\nthat love, and to make us humble, meek, and holy: we lay hold of this\ngospel, of these glad tidings; it is done unto us according to our\nfaith; and 'the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us,' through\nfaith which is in Christ Jesus\\.... \u00a0{GC 263.1}",
                "\"In the highest rank of the enemies of the gospel of Christ,\" said\nWesley, \"are they who openly and explicitly 'judge the law' itself, and\n'speak evil of the law;' who teach men to break (to dissolve, to loose,\nto untie the obligation of) not one only, whether of the least or of the\ngreatest, but all the commandments at a stroke\\.... The most surprising\nof all the circumstances that attend this strong delusion, is that they\nwho are given up to it, really believe that they honor Christ by\noverthrowing His law, and that they are magnifying His office while they\nare destroying His doctrine! Yea, they honor Him just as Judas did when\nhe said, 'Hail, Master, and kissed Him.' And He may as justly say to\nevery one of them, 'Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?' It is no\nother than betraying Him with a kiss, to talk of His blood, and take\naway His crown; to set light by any part of His law, under pretense of\nadvancing His gospel. Nor indeed can anyone escape this charge, who\npreaches faith in any such a manner as either directly or indirectly\ntends to set aside any branch of obedience: who preaches Christ so as to\ndisannul, or weaken in any wise, the least of the commandments of\nGod.\"---*Ibid*. \u00a0{GC 263.2}",
                "To those who urged that \"the preaching of the gospel answers all the\nends of the law,\" Wesley replied: \"This we utterly deny. It does not\nanswer the very first end of the law, namely, the convincing men of sin,\nthe awakening those who are still asleep on the brink of hell.\" The\napostle Paul declares that \"by the law is the knowledge of sin;\" \"and\nnot until man is convicted of sin, will he truly feel his need of the\natoning blood of Christ\\.... 'They that be whole,' as our Lord Himself\nobserves, 'need not a physician, but they that are sick.' It is absurd,\ntherefore, to offer a physician to them that are whole, or that at least\nimagine themselves so to be. You are first to convince them that they\nare sick; otherwise they will not thank you for your labor. It is\nequally absurd to offer Christ to them whose heart is whole, having\nnever yet been broken.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0sermon 35. \u00a0{GC 264.1}",
                "Thus while preaching the gospel of the grace of God, Wesley, like his\nMaster, sought to \"magnify the law, and make it honorable.\" Faithfully\ndid he accomplish the work given him of God, and glorious were the\nresults which he was permitted to behold. At the close of his long life\nof more than fourscore years---above half a century spent in itinerant\nministry---his avowed adherents numbered more than half a million souls.\nBut the multitude that through his labors had been lifted from the ruin\nand degradation of sin to a higher and a purer life, and the number who\nby his teaching had attained to a deeper and richer experience, will\nnever be known till the whole family of the redeemed shall be gathered\ninto the kingdom of God. His life presents a lesson of priceless worth\nto every Christian. Would that the faith and humility, the untiring\nzeal, self-sacrifice, and devotion of this servant of Christ might be\nreflected in the churches of today! \u00a0{GC 264.2}"

                "In the sixteenth century the Reformation, presenting an open Bible to\nthe people, had sought admission to all the countries of Europe. Some\nnations welcomed it with gladness, as a messenger of Heaven. In other\nlands the papacy succeeded to a great extent in preventing its entrance;\nand the light of Bible knowledge, with its elevating influences, was\nalmost wholly excluded. In one country, though the light found entrance,\nit was not comprehended by the darkness. For centuries, truth and error\nstruggled for the mastery. At last the evil triumphed, and the truth of\nHeaven was thrust out. \"This is the condemnation, that light is come\ninto the world, and men loved darkness rather than light.\" \u00a0John 3:19.\nThe nation was left to reap the results of the course which she had\nchosen. The restraint of God's Spirit was removed from a people that had\ndespised the gift of His grace. Evil was permitted to come to maturity.\nAnd all the world saw the fruit of willful rejection of the light. \u00a0{GC\n265.1}",
                "The war against the Bible, carried forward for so many centuries in\nFrance, culminated in the scenes of the Revolution. That terrible\noutbreaking was but the legitimate result of Rome's suppression of the\nScriptures. (See \u00a0Appendix.) It presented the most striking illustration\nwhich the world has ever witnessed of the working out of the papal\npolicy---an illustration of the results to which for more than a\nthousand \u00a0years the teaching of the Roman Church had been tending. \u00a0{GC\n265.2}",
                "The suppression of the Scriptures during the period of papal supremacy\nwas foretold by the prophets; and the Revelator points also to the\nterrible results that were to accrue especially to France from the\ndomination of the \"man of sin.\" \u00a0{GC 266.1}",
                "Said the angel of the Lord: \"The holy city shall they tread underfoot\nforty and two months. And I will give power unto My two witnesses, and\nthey shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed\nin sackcloth\\.... And when they shall have finished their testimony, the\nbeast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against\nthem, and shall overcome them, and kill them. And their dead bodies\nshall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called\nSodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified\\.... And they that\ndwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall\nsend gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them\nthat dwelt on the earth. And after three days and a half the Spirit of\nlife from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and\ngreat fear fell upon them which saw them.\" \u00a0Revelation 11:2-11. \u00a0{GC\n266.2}",
                "The periods here mentioned---\"forty and two months,\" and \"a thousand two\nhundred and threescore days\"---are the same, alike representing the time\nin which the church of Christ was to suffer oppression from Rome. The\n1260 years of papal supremacy began in A.D. 538, and would therefore\nterminate in 1798. (See \u00a0Appendix \u00a0note for page 54.) At that time a\nFrench army entered Rome and made the pope a prisoner, and he died in\nexile. Though a new pope was soon afterward elected, the papal hierarchy\nhas never since been able to wield the power which it before\npossessed. \u00a0{GC 266.3}",
                "The persecution of the church did not continue throughout the entire\nperiod of the 1260 years. God in mercy to His people cut short the time\nof their fiery trial. In foretelling the \u00a0\"great tribulation\" to befall\nthe church, the Saviour said: \"Except those days should be shortened,\nthere should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days\nshall be shortened.\" \u00a0Matthew 24:22.

The two witnesses\nrepresent the Scriptures of the Old and the New Testament. Both are\nimportant testimonies to the origin and perpetuity of the law of God.\nBoth are witnesses also to the plan of salvation. The types, sacrifices,\nand prophecies of the Old Testament point forward to a Saviour to come.\nThe Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament tell of a Saviour who has\ncome in the exact manner foretold by type and prophecy. \u00a0{GC 267.1}",
                "\"They shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three-score days,\nclothed in sackcloth.\" During the greater part of this period, God's\nwitnesses remained in a state of obscurity. The papal power sought to\nhide from the people the word of truth, and set before them false\nwitnesses to contradict its testimony. (See \u00a0Appendix.) When the Bible\nwas proscribed by religious and secular authority; when its testimony\nwas perverted, and every effort made that men and demons could invent to\nturn the minds of the people from it; when those who dared proclaim its\nsacred truths were hunted, betrayed, tortured, buried in dungeon cells,\nmartyred for their faith, or compelled to flee to mountain fastnesses,\nand to dens and caves of the earth---then the faithful witnesses\nprophesied in sackcloth. Yet they continued their testimony throughout\nthe entire period of 1260 years. In the darkest times there were\nfaithful men who loved God's word and were jealous for His honor. To\nthese loyal servants were \u00a0given wisdom, power, and authority to declare\nHis truth during the whole of this time. \u00a0{GC 267.2}",

Men cannot with impunity trample\nupon the word of God. The meaning of this fearful denunciation is set\nforth in the closing chapter of the Revelation: \"I testify unto every\nman that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man\nshall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are\nwritten in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of\nthe book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book\nof life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written\nin this book.\" \u00a0Revelation 22:18, 19. \u00a0{GC 268.1}",

These solemn\ndenunciations apply to all who by their influence lead men to regard\nlightly the law of God. They should cause those to fear and tremble who\nflippantly declare it a matter of little consequence whether we obey\nGod's law or not. All who exalt their own opinions above divine\nrevelation, all who would change the plain meaning of Scripture to suit\ntheir own convenience, or for the sake of conforming to the world, are\ntaking upon themselves a fearful responsibility. The written word, the\nlaw of God, will measure the character of every man and condemn all whom\nthis unerring test shall declare wanting. \u00a0{GC 268.2}",
                "\"When they shall have finished \\[are finishing\\] their testimony.\" The\nperiod when the two witnesses were to prophesy clothed in sackcloth,\nended in 1798. As they were approaching the termination of their work in\nobscurity, war was to be made upon them by the power represented as \"the\nbeast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit.\" In many of the nations\nof Europe the powers that ruled in church and state had for centuries\nbeen controlled by Satan through the \u00a0medium of the papacy. But here is\nbrought to view a new manifestation of satanic power. \u00a0{GC 268.3}",
                "It had been Rome's policy, under a profession of reverence for the\nBible, to keep it locked up in an unknown tongue and hidden away from\nthe people.

                "\"The great city\" in whose streets the witnesses are slain, and where\ntheir dead bodies lie, is \"spiritually\" Egypt. Of all nations presented\nin Bible history, Egypt most boldly denied the existence of the living\nGod and resisted His commands. No monarch ever ventured upon more open\nand highhanded rebellion against the authority of Heaven than did the\nking of Egypt. When the message was brought him by Moses, in the name of\nthe Lord, Pharaoh proudly answered: \"Who is Jehovah, that I should\nhearken unto His voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and\nmoreover I will not let Israel go.\" \u00a0Exodus 5:2, A.R.V. This is atheism,\nand the nation represented by Egypt would give voice to a similar denial\nof the claims of the living God and would manifest a like spirit of\nunbelief and defiance. \"The great city\" is also compared, \"spiritually,\"\nto Sodom. The corruption of Sodom in breaking the law of God was\nespecially manifested in licentiousness.

                "This prophecy has received a most exact and striking fulfillment in the\nhistory of France. During the Revolution, in 1793, \"the world for the\nfirst time heard an assembly of men, \u00a0born and educated in civilization,\nand assuming the right to govern one of the finest of the European\nnations, uplift their united voice to deny the most solemn truth which\nman's soul receives, and renounce unanimously the belief and worship of\na Deity.\"---Sir Walter Scott, \u00a0*Life of Napoleon,* \u00a0vol. 1, ch. 17.\n\"France is the only nation in the world concerning which the authentic\nrecord survives, that as a nation she lifted her hand in open rebellion\nagainst the Author of the universe.

                "France presented also the characteristics which especially distinguished\nSodom. During the Revolution there was manifest a state of moral\ndebasement and corruption similar to that which brought destruction upon\nthe cities of the plain. And the historian presents together the atheism\nand the licentiousness of France, as given in the prophecy: \"Intimately\nconnected with these laws affecting religion, was that which reduced the\nunion of marriage---the most sacred engagement which human beings can\nform, and the permanence of which leads most strongly to the\nconsolidation of society---to the state of a mere civil contract of a\ntransitory character, which any two persons might engage in and cast\nloose at pleasure\\.... If fiends had set themselves to work to discover\na mode of most effectually destroying whatever is venerable, graceful,\nor permanent in domestic life, and of obtaining at the same time an\nassurance that the mischief which it was their object to create should\nbe perpetuated from one generation to another, they could not have\ninvented a more effectual plan than the degradation of marriage\\....\nSophie Arnoult, an \u00a0actress famous for the witty things she said,\ndescribed the republican marriage as 'the sacrament of\nadultery.'\"---Scott, vol. 1, ch. 17. \u00a0{GC 270.1}",
                "\"Where also our Lord was crucified.\" This specification of the prophecy\nwas also fulfilled by France. In no land had the spirit of enmity\nagainst Christ been more strikingly displayed. In no country had the\ntruth encountered more bitter and cruel opposition. In the persecution\nwhich France had visited upon the confessors of the gospel, she had\ncrucified Christ in the person of His disciples. \u00a0{GC 271.1}",

While the\nWaldenses laid down their lives upon the mountains of Piedmont \"for the\nword of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ,\" similar witness to\nthe truth had been borne by their brethren, the Albigenses of France. In\nthe days of the Reformation its disciples had been put to death with\nhorrible tortures. King and nobles, highborn women and delicate maidens,\nthe pride and chivalry of the nation, had feasted their eyes upon the\nagonies of the martyrs of Jesus. The brave Huguenots, battling for those\nrights which the human heart holds most sacred, had poured out their\nblood on many a hard-fought field.

As they ventured to meet by night on mountainside or\nlonely moor, they were chased by dragoons and dragged away to lifelong\nslavery in the galleys. The purest, the most refined, and the most\nintelligent of the French were chained, in horrible torture, amidst\nrobbers and assassins. (See Wylie, b. 22, ch. 6.)

But the Saviour\ndeclares: \"He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall\nhave the light of life.\" \u00a0John 8:12. Whoever is with singleness of\npurpose seeking to do God's will, earnestly heeding the light already\ngiven, will receive greater light; to that soul some star of heavenly\nradiance will be sent to guide him into all truth. \u00a0{GC 312.3}",

God committed these\nprophecies to the Jewish leaders; they were without excuse if they did\nnot know and declare to the people that the Messiah's coming was at\nhand. Their ignorance was the result of sinful neglect. The Jews were\nbuilding monuments for the slain prophets of God, while by their\ndeference to the great men of earth they were paying homage to the\nservants of Satan.

Christ had stooped to take upon\nHimself man's nature; He was to bear an infinite \u00a0weight of woe as He\nshould make His soul an offering for sin; yet angels desired that even\nin His humiliation the Son of the Highest might appear before men with a\ndignity and glory befitting His character.

But they were at ease, \u00a0dreaming of peace and safety, while the\npeople were asleep in their sins. Jesus saw His church, like the barren\nfig tree, covered with pretentious leaves, yet destitute of precious\nfruit. There was a boastful observance of the forms of religion, while\nthe spirit of true humility, penitence, and faith---which alone could\nrender the service acceptable to God---was lacking. Instead of the\ngraces of the Spirit there were manifested pride, formalism, vainglory,\nselfishness, oppression. A backsliding church closed their eyes to the\nsigns of the times. God did not forsake them, or suffer His faithfulness\nto fail; but they departed from Him, and separated themselves from His\nlove.

Obedience requires a sacrifice\nand involves a cross; and this is why so many of the professed followers\nof Christ refused to receive the light from heaven, and, like the Jews\nof old, knew not the time of their visitation. \u00a0Luke 19:44.

Like many other reformers,\nWilliam Miller had in early life battled with poverty and had thus\nlearned the great lessons of energy and self-denial. The members of the\nfamily from which he sprang were characterized by an independent,\nliberty-loving spirit, by capability of endurance, and ardent\npatriotism---traits which were also prominent in his character. His\nfather was a captain in the army of the Revolution, and to the\nsacrifices which he made in the struggles and sufferings of that stormy\nperiod may be traced the straitened circumstances of Miller's early\nlife. \u00a0{GC 317.1}",
                "He had a sound physical constitution, and even in childhood gave\nevidence of more than ordinary intellectual strength. As he grew older,\nthis became more marked. His mind was active and well developed, and he\nhad a keen thirst for knowledge. Though he did not enjoy the advantages\nof a collegiate education, his love of study and a habit of careful\nthought and close criticism rendered him a man of sound judgment and\ncomprehensive views. He possessed an irreproachable moral character and\nan enviable reputation, being generally esteemed for integrity, thrift,\nand benevolence. By dint of energy and application he early acquired\na \u00a0competence, though his habits of study were still maintained. He\nfilled various civil and military offices with credit, and the avenues\nto wealth and honor seemed wide open to him. \u00a0{GC 317.2}",
                "His mother was a woman of sterling piety, and in childhood, he had been\nsubject to religious impressions. In early manhood, however, he was\nthrown into the society of deists, whose influence was the stronger from\nthe fact that they were mostly good citizens and men of humane and\nbenevolent disposition. Living, as they did, in the midst of Christian\ninstitutions, their characters had been to some extent molded by their\nsurroundings. For the excellencies which won them respect and confidence\nthey were indebted to the Bible; and yet these good gifts were so\nperverted as to exert an influence against the word of God. By\nassociation with these men, Miller was led to adopt their sentiments.\nThe current interpretations of Scripture presented difficulties which\nseemed to him insurmountable; yet his new belief, while setting aside\nthe Bible, offered nothing better to take its place, and he remained far\nfrom satisfied. He continued to hold these views, however, for about\ntwelve years. But at the age of thirty-four the Holy Spirit impressed\nhis heart with a sense of his condition as a sinner. He found in his\nformer belief no assurance of happiness beyond the grave. The future was\ndark and gloomy. Referring afterward to his feelings at this time, he\nsaid: \u00a0{GC 318.1}",

I tried to stop\nthinking, but my thoughts would not be controlled. I was truly wretched,\nbut did not understand the cause. I murmured and complained, but knew\nnot of whom.

My mind became settled and satisfied. I found the Lord\nGod to be a Rock in the midst of the ocean of life. The Bible now became\nmy chief study, and I can truly say, I searched it with great delight. I\nfound the half was never told me. I wondered why I had not seen its\nbeauty and glory before, and marveled that I could have ever rejected\nit.

                "Endeavoring to lay aside all preconceived opinions, and dispensing with\ncommentaries, he compared scripture with scripture by the aid of the\nmarginal references and the concordance. He pursued his study in a\nregular and methodical manner; beginning with Genesis, and reading verse\nby verse, he proceeded no faster than the meaning of the several\npassages so unfolded as to leave him free from all embarrassment. When\nhe found anything obscure, it was his custom to compare it with every\nother text which seemed to have any reference to the matter under\nconsideration. Every word was permitted to have its proper bearing upon\nthe subject of the text, and if his view of it harmonized with every\ncollateral passage, it ceased to be a difficulty. Thus whenever he met\nwith a passage hard to be understood he found an explanation in some\nother portion of the Scriptures. As he studied with earnest prayer for\ndivine enlightenment, that which had before appeared dark to his\nunderstanding was made clear. He experienced the truth of the psalmist's\nwords: \"The entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding\nunto the simple.\" \u00a0Psalm 119:130. \u00a0{GC 320.1}",

He saw that the prophecies, so far as they had been\nfulfilled, had been fulfilled literally; that all the various figures,\nmetaphors, parables, similitudes, etc., were either explained in their\nimmediate connection, or the terms in which they were expressed were\ndefined in other scriptures, and when thus explained, were to be\nliterally understood. \"I was thus satisfied,\" he says, \"that the Bible\nis a system of revealed truths, so clearly and simply given that the\nwayfaring man, though \u00a0a fool, need not err therein.\"---Bliss, page 70.\nLink after link of the chain of truth rewarded his efforts, as step by\nstep he traced down the great lines of prophecy.

                "Taking the manner in which the prophecies had been fulfilled in the past\nas a criterion by which to judge of the fulfillment of those which were\nstill future, he became satisfied that the popular view of the spiritual\nreign of Christ---a temporal millennium before the end of the\nworld---was not sustained by the word of God. This doctrine, pointing to\na thousand years of righteousness and peace before the personal coming\nof the Lord, put far off the terrors of the day of God. But, pleasing\nthough it may be, it is contrary to the teachings of Christ and His\napostles, who declared that the wheat and the tares are to grow together\nuntil the harvest, the end of the world; that \"evil men and seducers\nshall wax worse and worse;\" that \"in the last days perilous times shall\ncome;\" and that the kingdom of darkness shall continue until the advent\nof the Lord and shall be consumed with the spirit of His mouth and be\ndestroyed with the brightness of His coming. \u00a0Matthew 13:30, 38-41; \u00a02\nTimothy 3:13, 1; \u00a02 Thessalonians 2:8. \u00a0{GC 321.1}",
                "The doctrine of the world's conversion and the spiritual reign of Christ\nwas not held by the apostolic church. It was not generally accepted by\nChristians until about the beginning of the eighteenth century. Like\nevery other error, its results were evil. It taught men to look far in\nthe future for the coming of the Lord and prevented them from giving\nheed to the signs heralding His approach. It induced a feeling of\nconfidence and security that was not well founded and led many to\nneglect the preparation necessary in order to meet their Lord. \u00a0{GC\n321.2}",
                "Miller found the literal, personal coming of Christ to be plainly taught\nin the Scriptures. Says Paul: \"The Lord Himself shall descend from\nheaven with a shout, with the voice \u00a0of the Archangel, and with the trump\nof God.\" \u00a01 Thessalonians 4:16. And the Saviour declares: \"They\nshall \u00a0*see* \u00a0the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and\ngreat glory.\" \"For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth\neven unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man\nbe.\" \u00a0Matthew 24:30, 27. He is to be accompanied by all the hosts of\nheaven. \"The Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels\nwith Him.\" \u00a0Matthew 25:31. \"And He shall send His angels with a great\nsound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect.\" \u00a0Matthew\n24:31. \u00a0{GC 321.3}",
                "At His coming the righteous dead will be raised, and the righteous\nliving will be changed. \"We shall not all sleep,\" says Paul, \"but we\nshall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the\nlast trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised\nincorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on\nincorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\" \u00a01 Corinthians\n15:51-53. And in his letter to the Thessalonians, after describing the\ncoming of the Lord, he says: \"The dead in Christ shall rise first: then\nwe which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in\nthe clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with\nthe Lord.\" \u00a01 Thessalonians 4:16, 17. \u00a0{GC 322.1}",
                "Not until the personal advent of Christ can His people receive the\nkingdom. The Saviour said: \"When the Son of man shall come in His glory,\nand all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of\nHis glory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall\nseparate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from\nthe goats: and He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats\non the left. Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come,\nye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the\nfoundation of the world.\" \u00a0Matthew 25:31-34. We have seen by the\nscriptures just given that when the Son of man comes, the dead are\nraised incorruptible and the living are changed. By this great \u00a0change\nthey are prepared to receive the kingdom; for Paul says: \"Flesh and\nblood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit\nincorruption.\" \u00a01 Corinthians 15:50. Man in his present state is mortal,\ncorruptible; but the kingdom of God will be incorruptible, enduring\nforever. Therefore man in his present state cannot enter into the\nkingdom of God. But when Jesus comes, He confers immortality upon His\npeople; and then He calls them to inherit the kingdom of which they have\nhitherto been only heirs. \u00a0{GC 322.2}",
                "These and other scriptures clearly proved to Miller's mind that the\nevents which were generally expected to take place before the coming of\nChrist, such as the universal reign of peace and the setting up of the\nkingdom of God upon the earth, were to be subsequent to the second\nadvent. Furthermore, all the signs of the times and the condition of the\nworld corresponded to the prophetic description of the last days. He was\nforced to the conclusion, from the study of Scripture alone, that the\nperiod allotted for the continuance of the earth in its present state\nwas about to close. \u00a0{GC 323.1}",
                "\"Another kind of evidence that vitally affected my mind,\" he says, \"was\nthe chronology of the Scriptures\\....

                "The prophecy which seemed most clearly to reveal the \u00a0*time* \u00a0of the\nsecond advent was that of \u00a0Daniel 8:14: \"Unto two thousand and three\nhundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\" Following his rule\nof making Scripture its own interpreter, Miller learned that a day in\nsymbolic prophecy represents a year (Numbers 14:34; \u00a0Ezekiel 4:6); he saw\nthat the period of 2300 prophetic days, or literal years, would extend\nfar beyond the close of the Jewish dispensation, hence it could not\nrefer to the sanctuary of that dispensation. Miller accepted the\ngenerally received view that in the Christian age \u00a0the earth is the\nsanctuary, and he therefore understood that the cleansing of the\nsanctuary foretold in \u00a0Daniel 8:14 \u00a0represented the purification of the\nearth by fire at the second coming of Christ. If, then, the correct\nstarting point could be found for the 2300 days, he concluded that the\ntime of the second advent could be readily ascertained. Thus would be\nrevealed the time of that great consummation, the time when the present\nstate, with \"all its pride and power, pomp and vanity, wickedness and\noppression, would come to an end;\" when the curse would be \"removed from\noff the earth, death be destroyed, reward be given to the servants of\nGod, the prophets and saints, and them who fear His name, and those be\ndestroyed that destroy the earth.\"---Bliss, page 76. \u00a0{GC 324.3}",
                "With a new and deeper earnestness, Miller continued the examination of\nthe prophecies, whole nights as well as days being devoted to the study\nof what now appeared of such stupendous importance and all-absorbing\ninterest. In the eighth chapter of Daniel he could find no clue to the\nstarting point of the 2300 days; the angel Gabriel, though commanded to\nmake Daniel understand the vision, gave him only a partial explanation.\nAs the terrible persecution to befall the church was unfolded to the\nprophet's vision, physical strength gave way.

But\nfrom what were they cut off? As the 2300 days was the only period of\ntime mentioned in chapter 8, it must be the period from which the\nseventy weeks were cut off; the seventy weeks must therefore be a part\nof the 2300 days, and the two periods must begin together. The seventy\nweeks were declared by the angel to date from the going forth of the\ncommandment to restore and build Jerusalem.

All the contradictions and inconsistencies\nI had before found in the word were gone; and although there were many\nportions of which I was not satisfied I had a full understanding, yet so\nmuch light had emanated from it to the illumination of my before\ndarkened mind, that I felt a delight in studying the Scripture which I\nhad not before supposed could be derived from its teachings.\"---Bliss,\npages 76, 77. \u00a0{GC 329.2}",

He expected to encounter opposition from the\nungodly, but was confident that all Christians would rejoice in the hope\nof meeting the Saviour whom they professed to love. His only fear was\nthat in their great joy at the prospect of glorious deliverance, so soon\nto be consummated, many would receive the doctrine without sufficiently\nexamining the Scriptures in demonstration of its truth. He therefore\nhesitated to present it, lest he should be in error and be the means of\nmisleading others. He was thus led to review the evidences in support of\nthe conclusions at which he had arrived, and to consider carefully every\ndifficulty which presented itself to his mind.

It was his\ninvariable rule not to labor in any place to which he had not been\ninvited, yet he soon found himself unable to comply with half the\nrequests that poured in upon him. Many who did not accept his views as\nto the exact time of the second advent were convinced of the certainty\nand nearness of Christ's coming and their need of preparation. In some\nof the large cities his work produced a marked impression. Liquor\ndealers abandoned the traffic and turned their shops into meeting rooms;\ngambling dens were broken up; infidels, deists, Universalists, and even\nthe most abandoned profligates were reformed, some of whom had not\nentered a house of worship for years. Prayer meetings were established\nby the various denominations, in different quarters, at almost every\nhour, businessmen assembling at midday for prayer and praise. There was\nno extravagant excitement, but an almost universal solemnity on the\nminds of the people.

For several years his expenses were met\nwholly from his own private purse, and he never afterward received\nenough to meet the expense of travel to the places where he was invited.\nThus his public labors, so far from being a pecuniary benefit, were a\nheavy tax upon his property, which gradually diminished during this\nperiod of his life.

                "In the typical system, which was a shadow of the sacrifice and\npriesthood of Christ, the cleansing of the sanctuary was the last\nservice performed by the high priest in the yearly round of\nministration. It was the closing work of the atonement---a removal or\nputting away of sin from Israel. It prefigured the closing work in the\nministration of our High Priest in heaven, in the removal or blotting\nout of the sins of His people, which are registered in the heavenly\nrecords. This service involves a work of investigation, a work of\njudgment; and it immediately precedes the coming of Christ in the clouds\nof heaven with power and great glory; for when He comes, every case has\nbeen decided. Says Jesus: \"My reward is with Me, to give every man\naccording as his work shall be.\" \u00a0Revelation 22:12. It is this work of\njudgment, immediately preceding the second advent, that is announced in\nthe first angel's message of \u00a0Revelation 14:7: \"Fear God, and give glory\nto Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.\" \u00a0{GC 352.2}",
                "Those who proclaimed this warning gave the right message at the right\ntime. But as the early disciples declared, \"The time is fulfilled, and\nthe kingdom of God is at hand,\" \u00a0based on the prophecy of \u00a0Daniel 9, while\nthey failed to perceive that the death of the Messiah was foretold in\nthe same scripture, so Miller and his associates preached the message\nbased on \u00a0Daniel 8:14 \u00a0and \u00a0Revelation 14:7, and failed to see that there\nwere still other messages brought to view in \u00a0Revelation 14, which were\nalso to be given before the advent of the Lord. As the disciples were\nmistaken in regard to the kingdom to be set up at the end of the seventy\nweeks, so Adventists were mistaken in regard to the event to take place\nat the expiration of the 2300 days. In both cases there was an\nacceptance of, or rather an adherence to, popular errors that blinded\nthe mind to the truth. Both classes fulfilled the will of God in\ndelivering the message which He desired to be given, and both, through\ntheir own misapprehension of their message, suffered disappointment. \u00a0{GC\n352.3}",
                "Yet God accomplished His own beneficent purpose in permitting the\nwarning of the judgment to be given just as it was. The great day was at\nhand, and in His providence the people were brought to the test of a\ndefinite time, in order to reveal to them what was in their hearts. The\nmessage was designed for the testing and purification of the church.\nThey were to be led to see whether their affections were set upon this\nworld or upon Christ and heaven. They professed to love the Saviour; now\nthey were to prove their love. Were they ready to renounce their worldly\nhopes and ambitions, and welcome with joy the advent of their Lord? The\nmessage was designed to enable them to discern their true spiritual\nstate; it was sent in mercy to arouse them to seek the Lord with\nrepentance and humiliation. \u00a0{GC 353.1}",
                "The disappointment also, though the result of their own misapprehension\nof the message which they gave, was to be overruled for good. It would\ntest the hearts of those who had professed to receive the warning. In\nthe face of their disappointment would they rashly give up their\nexperience and cast away their confidence in God's word? or would they,\nin \u00a0prayer and humility, seek to discern where they had failed to\ncomprehend the significance of the prophecy? How many had moved from\nfear, or from impulse and excitement? How many were halfhearted and\nunbelieving? Multitudes professed to love the appearing of the Lord.\nWhen called to endure the scoffs and reproach of the world, and the test\nof delay and disappointment, would they renounce the faith? Because they\ndid not immediately understand the dealings of God with them, would they\ncast aside truths sustained by the clearest testimony of His word? \u00a0{GC\n353.2}",
                "This test would reveal the strength of those who with real faith had\nobeyed what they believed to be the teaching of the word and the Spirit\nof God. It would teach them, as only such an experience could, the\ndanger of accepting the theories and interpretations of men, instead of\nmaking the Bible its own interpreter. To the children of faith the\nperplexity and sorrow resulting from their error would work the needed\ncorrection. They would be led to a closer study of the prophetic word.\nThey would be taught to examine more carefully the foundation of their\nfaith, and to reject everything, however widely accepted by the\nChristian world, that was not founded upon the Scriptures of truth. \u00a0{GC\n354.1}",
                "With these believers, as with the first disciples, that which in the\nhour of trial seemed dark to their understanding would afterward be made\nplain. When they should see the \"end of the Lord\" they would know that,\nnotwithstanding the trial resulting from their errors, His purposes of\nlove toward them had been steadily fulfilling. They would learn by a\nblessed experience that He is \"very pitiful, and of tender mercy;\" that\nall His paths \"are mercy and truth unto such as keep His covenant and\nHis testimonies.\" \u00a0{GC 354.2}"

The prophecies present a\nsuccession of events leading down to the opening of the judgment. This\nis especially true of the book of Daniel.

Not till after the great apostasy, and the long period of the reign\nof the \"man of sin,\" can we look for the advent of our Lord. The \"man of\nsin,\" which is also styled \"the mystery of iniquity,\" \"the son of\nperdition,\" and \"that wicked,\" represents the papacy, which, as foretold\nin prophecy, was to maintain its supremacy for 1260 years. This period\nended in 1798. The coming of Christ could not take place before that\ntime. Paul covers with his caution the whole of the Christian\ndispensation down to the year 1798.

The Reformers did not proclaim it.\nMartin Luther placed the judgment about three hundred years in the\nfuture from his day. But since 1798 the book of Daniel has been\nunsealed, knowledge of the prophecies has increased, and many have\nproclaimed the solemn message of the judgment near. \u00a0{GC 356.2}",

In both\nEurope and America men of faith and prayer were led to the study of the\nprophecies, and, tracing down the inspired record, they saw convincing\nevidence that the end of all things was at hand. In different lands\nthere were isolated bodies of Christians who, solely by the study of the\nScriptures, arrived at the belief that the Saviour's advent was\nnear. \u00a0{GC 357.1}",
                "In 1821, three years after Miller had arrived at his exposition of the\nprophecies pointing to the time of the judgment, Dr. Joseph Wolff, \"the\nmissionary to the world,\" began to proclaim the Lord's soon coming.\nWolff was born in Germany, of Hebrew parentage, his father being a\nJewish rabbi. While very young he was convinced of the truth of the\nChristian religion. Of an active, inquiring mind, he had been an eager\nlistener to the conversations that took place in his father's house as\ndevout Hebrews daily assembled to recount the hopes and anticipations of\ntheir people, the glory of the coming Messiah, and the restoration of\nIsrael. One day hearing Jesus of Nazareth mentioned, the boy inquired\nwho He was. \"A Jew of the greatest talent,\" was the answer; \"but as He\npretended to be the Messiah, the Jewish tribunal sentenced Him to\ndeath.\" \"Why,\" rejoined the questioner, \"is Jerusalem destroyed, and why\nare we in captivity?\" \"Alas, alas!\" answered his father, \"because the\nJews murdered the prophets.\" The thought was at once suggested to the\nchild: \"Perhaps Jesus was also a prophet, and the Jews killed Him when\nHe was innocent.\"---*Travels and Adventures of the Rev. Joseph\nWolff,* \u00a0vol. 1, p. 6. So strong was this feeling that, though forbidden\nto enter a Christian church, he would often linger outside to listen to\nthe preaching. \u00a0{GC 357.2}",
                "When only seven years old he was boasting to an aged Christian neighbor\nof the future triumph of Israel at the advent of the Messiah, when the\nold man said kindly: \"Dear boy, I will tell you who the real Messiah\nwas: He was Jesus \u00a0of Nazareth, \\... whom your ancestors have crucified,\nas they did the prophets of old. Go home and read the fifty-third\nchapter of Isaiah, and you will be convinced that Jesus Christ is the\nSon of God.\"---*Ibid.,* \u00a0vol. 1, p. 7. Conviction at once fastened upon\nhim. He went home and read the scripture, wondering to see how perfectly\nit had been fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth. Were the words of the\nChristian true? The boy asked of his father an explanation of the\nprophecy, but was met with a silence so stern that he never again dared\nto refer to the subject. This, however, only increased his desire to\nknow more of the Christian religion. \u00a0{GC 357.3}",
                "The knowledge he sought was studiously kept from him in his Jewish home;\nbut, when only eleven years old, he left his father's house and went out\ninto the world to gain for himself an education, to choose his religion\nand his lifework. He found a home for a time with kinsmen, but was soon\ndriven from them as an apostate, and alone and penniless he had to make\nhis own way among strangers. He went from place to place, studying\ndiligently and maintaining himself by teaching Hebrew. Through the\ninfluence of a Catholic instructor he was led to accept the Romish faith\nand formed the purpose of becoming a missionary to his own people. With\nthis object he went, a few years later, to pursue his studies in the\nCollege of the Propaganda at Rome. Here his habit of independent thought\nand candid speech brought upon him the imputation of heresy. He openly\nattacked the abuses of the church and urged the necessity of reform.\nThough at first treated with special favor by the papal dignitaries, he\nwas after a time removed from Rome. Under the surveillance of the church\nhe went from place to place, until it became evident that he could never\nbe brought to submit to the bondage of Romanism. He was declared to be\nincorrigible and was left at liberty to go where he pleased. He now made\nhis way to England and, professing the Protestant faith, united with the\nEnglish Church.

When\nstanding before the people, \u00a0however, it was evident that they were moved\nby an influence beyond their own natural gifts. Tone and manner changed,\nand with solemn power they gave the warning of the judgment, employing\nthe very words of Scripture: \"Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the\nhour of His judgment is come.\" They reproved the sins of the people, not\nonly condemning immorality and vice, but rebuking worldliness and\nbacksliding, and warning their hearers to make haste to flee from the\nwrath to come. \u00a0{GC 366.3}",

When Jesus drew near to Jerusalem attended by the\nrejoicing multitudes that, with shouts of triumph and the waving of palm\nbranches, heralded Him as the Son of David, the jealous Pharisees called\nupon Him to silence them; but Jesus answered that all this was in\nfulfillment of prophecy, and if these should hold their peace, the very\nstones would cry out. The people, intimidated by the threats of the\npriests and rulers, ceased their joyful proclamation as they entered the\ngates of Jerusalem; but the children in the temple courts afterward took\nup the refrain, and, waving their branches of palm, they cried: \"Hosanna\nto the Son of David!\" \u00a0Matthew 21:8-16.

Many were convinced that the arguments from the\nprophetic periods were correct, and, sacrificing their pride of opinion,\nthey joyfully received the truth. Some ministers laid aside their\nsectarian views and feelings, left their salaries and their churches,\nand united in proclaiming the coming of Jesus. There were comparatively\nfew ministers, however, who would accept this message; therefore it was\nlargely committed to humble laymen. Farmers left their fields, mechanics\ntheir tools, traders their merchandise, professional men their\npositions; and yet the number of workers was small in comparison with\nthe work to be accomplished. The condition of an ungodly church and a\nworld lying in wickedness, burdened the souls of the true watchmen, and\nthey willingly endured toil, privation, and suffering, that they might\ncall men to repentance unto salvation.

The simple, direct testimony of\nthe Scriptures, set home by the power of the Holy Spirit, brought a\nweight of conviction which few were able wholly to resist. Professors of\nreligion were roused from their false security. They saw their\nbackslidings, their worldliness and unbelief, their pride and\nselfishness. Many sought the Lord with repentance and humiliation. The\naffections that had so long clung to earthly things they now fixed upon\nheaven.

The barriers of pride and reserve were swept\naway. Heartfelt confessions were made, and the members of the household\nlabored for the salvation of those who were nearest and dearest.

They had\nbeen unfaithful servants, their works would not bear the inspection of\nthe heart-searching God, and they feared to meet their Lord. Like the\nJews at the time of Christ's first advent they were not prepared to\nwelcome Jesus. They not only refused to listen to the plain arguments\nfrom the Bible, but ridiculed those who were looking for the Lord. Satan\nand his angels exulted, and flung the taunt in the face of Christ and\nholy angels that His professed people had so little love for Him that\nthey did not desire His appearing. \u00a0{GC 370.1}",
                "\"No man knoweth the day nor the hour\" was the argument most often\nbrought forward by rejecters of the advent faith. The scripture is: \"Of\nthat day and hour knoweth no \u00a0man, no not the angels of heaven, but My\nFather only.\" \u00a0Matthew 24:36. A clear and harmonious explanation of this\ntext was given by those who were looking for the Lord, and the wrong use\nmade of it by their opponents was clearly shown. The words were spoken\nby Christ in that memorable conversation with His disciples upon Olivet\nafter He had for the last time departed from the temple. The disciples\nhad asked the question: \"What shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of\nthe end of the world?\" Jesus gave them signs, and said: \"When ye shall\nsee all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.\" \u00a0Verses\n3, 33. One saying of the Saviour must not be made to destroy another.\nThough no man knoweth the \u00a0*day* \u00a0nor the \u00a0*hour* \u00a0of His coming, we are\ninstructed and required to know when it is near. We are further taught\nthat to disregard His warning, and refuse or neglect to know when His\nadvent is near, will be as fatal for us as it was for those who lived in\nthe days of Noah not to know when the flood was coming. And the parable\nin the same chapter, contrasting the faithful and the unfaithful\nservant, and giving the doom of him who said in his heart, \"My Lord\ndelayeth His coming,\" shows in what light Christ will regard and reward\nthose whom He finds watching, and teaching His coming, and those denying\nit. \"Watch therefore,\" He says. \"Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord\nwhen He cometh shall find so doing.\" \u00a0Verses 42, 46. \"If therefore thou\nshalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know\nwhat hour I will come upon thee.\" \u00a0Revelation 3:3. \u00a0{GC 370.2}",
                "Paul speaks of a class to whom the Lord's appearing will come unawares.\n\"The day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they\nshall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them,\n\\... and they shall not escape.\" But he adds, to those who have given\nheed to the Saviour's warning: \"Ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that\nthat day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of\nlight, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of\ndarkness.\" \u00a01 Thessalonians 5:2-5. \u00a0{GC 371.1}",
                "Thus it was shown that Scripture gives no warrant for men to remain in\nignorance concerning the nearness of Christ's coming. But those who\ndesired only an excuse to reject the truth closed their ears to this\nexplanation, and the words \"No man knoweth the day nor the hour\"\ncontinued to be echoed by the bold scoffer and even by the professed\nminister of Christ. As the people were roused, and began to inquire the\nway of salvation, religious teachers stepped in between them and the\ntruth, seeking to quiet their fears by falsely interpreting the word of\nGod. Unfaithful watchmen united in the work of the great deceiver,\ncrying, Peace, peace, when God had not spoken peace. Like the Pharisees\nin Christ's day, many refused to enter the kingdom of heaven themselves,\nand those who were entering in they hindered. The blood of these souls\nwill be required at their hand. \u00a0{GC 372.1}",

Those who studied the Bible for themselves could\nnot but see the unscriptural character of the popular views of prophecy;\nand wherever the people were not controlled by the influence of the\nclergy, wherever they would search the word of God for themselves, the\nadvent doctrine needed only to be compared with the Scriptures to\nestablish its divine authority. \u00a0{GC 372.2}",

Very precious to those\nwho bore this trial of their faith were the words of the prophet: \"Your\nbrethren that hated you, that cast you out for My name's sake, said, Let\nthe Lord be glorified: but He shall appear to your joy, and they shall\nbe ashamed.\" \u00a0Isaiah 66:5. \u00a0{GC 372.3}",

Many were misled by\nhusbands, wives, parents, or children, and were made to believe it a sin\neven to listen to such heresies as were taught by the Adventists. Angels\nwere bidden to keep faithful watch over these souls, for another light\nwas yet to shine upon them from the throne of God. \u00a0{GC 372.4}",

None who experienced this hope and trust can\nforget those precious hours of waiting. For some weeks preceding the\ntime, worldly business was for the most part laid aside. The sincere\nbelievers carefully examined every thought and emotion of their hearts\nas if upon their deathbeds and in a few hours to close their eyes upon\nearthly scenes. There was no making of \"ascension robes\" (see \u00a0Appendix);\nbut all felt the need of internal evidence that they were prepared to\nmeet the Saviour; their white robes were purity of soul---characters\ncleansed from sin by the atoning blood of Christ. Would that there were\nstill with the professed people of God the same spirit of heart\nsearching, the same earnest, determined faith. Had they continued thus\nto humble themselves before the Lord and press their petitions at the\nmercy seat they would be in possession of a far richer experience than\nthey now have. There is too little prayer, too little real conviction of\nsin, and the lack of living faith leaves many destitute of the grace so\nrichly provided by our Redeemer. \u00a0{GC 373.1}",

In the fear of God they had studied the Scriptures\nto learn the truth, and had earnestly sought for purity of heart and\nlife.

These had been familiar words to all believers\nin the Lord's soon coming. By the lips of thousands was this prophecy\nrepeated as the watchword of their faith. All felt that upon the events\ntherein foretold depended their brightest expectations and most\ncherished hopes. These prophetic days had been shown to terminate in the\nautumn of 1844. In common with the rest of the Christian world,\nAdventists then held that the earth, or some portion of it, was the\nsanctuary. They understood that the cleansing of the sanctuary was the\npurification of the earth by the fires of the last great day, and that\nthis would take place at the second advent. Hence the conclusion that\nChrist would return to the earth in 1844. \u00a0{GC 409.1}",

They argued that if the prophetic days had ended\nin 1844, Christ would then have returned to \u00a0cleanse the sanctuary by the\npurification of the earth by fire; and that since He had not come, the\ndays could not have ended. \u00a0{GC 409.2}",

Taking this as the starting\npoint, there was perfect harmony in the application of all the events\nforetold in the explanation of that period in \u00a0Daniel 9:25-27. Sixty-nine\nweeks, the first 483 of the 2300 years, were to reach to the Messiah,\nthe Anointed One; and Christ's baptism and anointing by the Holy Spirit,\nA.D. 27, exactly fulfilled the specification. In the midst of the\nseventieth week, Messiah was to be cut off. Three and a half years after\nHis baptism, Christ was crucified, in the spring of A.D. 31. The seventy\nweeks, or 490 years, were to pertain especially to the Jews. At the\nexpiration of this period the nation sealed its rejection of Christ by\nthe persecution of His disciples, and the apostles turned to the\nGentiles, A.D. 34. The first 490 years of the 2300 having then ended,\n1810 years would remain. From A.D. 34, 1810 years extend to 1844.\n\"Then,\" said the angel, \"shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\" All the\npreceding specifications of the prophecy had been unquestionably\nfulfilled at the time appointed. \u00a0{GC 410.1}",

Day by day the repentant sinner brought\nhis offering to the door of the tabernacle and, placing his hand upon\nthe victim's head, confessed his sins, thus in figure transferring them\nfrom himself to the innocent sacrifice. The animal was then slain.\n\"Without shedding of blood,\" says the apostle, there is no remission of\nsin. \"The life of the flesh is in the blood.\" \u00a0Leviticus 17:11. The\nbroken law of God demanded the life of the transgressor. The blood,\nrepresenting the forfeited life of the sinner, whose guilt the victim\nbore, was carried by the priest into the holy place and sprinkled before\nthe veil, behind which was the ark containing the law that the sinner\nhad transgressed. By this ceremony the sin was, through the blood,\ntransferred in figure to the sanctuary. In some cases the blood was not\ntaken into the holy place; but the flesh was then to be eaten by the\npriest, as Moses directed the sons of Aaron, saying: \"God hath given it\nyou to bear the iniquity of the congregation.\" \u00a0Leviticus 10:17. Both\nceremonies alike symbolized the transfer of the sin from the penitent to\nthe sanctuary. \u00a0{GC 418.1}",

On the Day of Atonement the high priest, having\ntaken an offering from the congregation, went into the most holy place\nwith the blood of this offering, and sprinkled it upon the mercy seat,\ndirectly over the law, to make satisfaction for its claims. Then, in his\ncharacter of mediator, he took the sins upon himself and bore them from\nthe sanctuary.

But before this can\nbe accomplished, there must be an examination of the books of record to\ndetermine who, through repentance of sin and faith in Christ, are\nentitled to the benefits of His atonement.

As the disciples of Jesus\nafter the terrible night of their anguish and disappointment were \"glad\nwhen they saw the Lord,\" so did those now rejoice who had looked in\nfaith for His second coming. They had expected Him to appear in glory to\ngive reward to His servants. As their hopes were disappointed, they had\nlost sight of Jesus, and with Mary at the sepulcher they cried: \"They\nhave taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\" Now\nin the holy of holies they again beheld Him, their compassionate High\nPriest, soon to appear as their king and deliverer. Light from the\nsanctuary illumined the past, the present, and the future. They knew\nthat God had led them by His unerring providence. Though, like the first\ndisciples, they themselves had failed to understand the message which\nthey bore, yet it had been in every respect correct.

Because they rejected the warning, the Spirit of God was\nwithdrawn from the sinful race, and they perished in the waters of the\nFlood. In the time of Abraham, mercy ceased to plead with the guilty\ninhabitants of Sodom, and all but Lot with his wife and two daughters\nwere consumed by the fire sent down from heaven. So in the days of\nChrist. The Son of God declared to the unbelieving Jews of that\ngeneration: \"Your house is left unto you desolate.\" \u00a0Matthew 23:38.\nLooking down to the last days, the same Infinite Power declares,\nconcerning those who \"received not the love of the truth, that they\nmight be saved\": \"For this cause God shall send them strong delusion,\nthat they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who\nbelieved not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\" \u00a02\nThessalonians 2:10-12.

Their only relief, so far as\nascertaining their true position was \u00a0concerned, was the light which\ndirected their minds to the sanctuary above. Some renounced their faith\nin their former reckoning of the prophetic periods and ascribed to human\nor satanic agencies the powerful influence of the Holy Spirit which had\nattended the advent movement. Another class firmly held that the Lord\nhad led them in their past experience; and as they waited and watched\nand prayed to know the will of God they saw that their great High Priest\nhad entered upon another work of ministration, and, following Him by\nfaith, they were led to see also the closing work of the church.

                "The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple\nthe ark of His testament.\" \u00a0Revelation 11:19. The ark of God's testament\nis in the holy of holies, the second apartment of the sanctuary. In the\nministration of the earthly tabernacle, which served \"unto the example\nand shadow of heavenly things,\" this apartment was opened only upon the\ngreat Day of Atonement for the cleansing of the sanctuary. Therefore the\nannouncement that the temple of God was opened in heaven and the ark of\nHis testament was seen points to the opening of the most holy place of\nthe heavenly sanctuary in 1844 as Christ entered there to perform the\nclosing work of the atonement. Those who by faith followed their great\nHigh Priest as He entered upon His ministry in the most holy place,\nbeheld the ark of His testament. As they had studied the subject of the\nsanctuary they had come to understand the Saviour's change of\nministration, and they saw that He was now officiating before the ark of\nGod, pleading His blood in behalf of sinners. \u00a0{GC 433.1}",
                "The ark in the tabernacle on earth contained the two tables of stone,\nupon which were inscribed the precepts of the law of God. The ark was\nmerely a receptacle for the tables of the law, and the presence of these\ndivine precepts gave to it its value and sacredness. When the temple of\nGod was opened in heaven, the ark of His testament was seen. \u00a0Within the\nholy of holies, in the sanctuary in heaven, the divine law is sacredly\nenshrined---the law that was spoken by God Himself amid the thunders of\nSinai and written with His own finger on the tables of stone. \u00a0{GC 433.2}",
                "The law of God in the sanctuary in heaven is the great original, of\nwhich the precepts inscribed upon the tables of stone and recorded by\nMoses in the Pentateuch were an unerring transcript. Those who arrived\nat an understanding of this important point were thus led to see the\nsacred, unchanging character of the divine law. They saw, as never\nbefore, the force of the Saviour's words: \"Till heaven and earth pass,\none jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.\" \u00a0Matthew 5:18.\nThe law of God, being a revelation of His will, a transcript of His\ncharacter, must forever endure, \"as a faithful witness in heaven.\" Not\none command has been annulled; not a jot or tittle has been changed.\nSays the psalmist: \"Forever, O Lord, Thy word is settled in heaven.\"\n\"All His commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and\never.\" \u00a0Psalm 119:89; \u00a0111:7, 8. \u00a0{GC 434.1}",
                "In the very bosom of the Decalogue is the fourth commandment, as it was\nfirst proclaimed: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days\nshalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the\nSabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor\nthy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy\ncattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the\nLord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested\nthe seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and\nhallowed it.\" \u00a0Exodus 20:8-11. \u00a0{GC 434.2}",
                "The Spirit of God impressed the hearts of those students of His word.\nThe conviction was urged upon them that they had ignorantly transgressed\nthis precept by disregarding the Creator's rest day. They began to\nexamine the reasons for observing the first day of the week instead of\nthe day which God had sanctified. They could find no evidence in\nthe \u00a0Scriptures that the fourth commandment had been abolished, or that\nthe Sabbath had been changed; the blessing which first hallowed the\nseventh day had never been removed. They had been honestly seeking to\nknow and to do God's will; now, as they saw themselves transgressors of\nHis law, sorrow filled their hearts, and they manifested their loyalty\nto God by keeping His Sabbath holy. \u00a0{GC 434.3}",
                "Many and earnest were the efforts made to overthrow their faith. None\ncould fail to see that if the earthly sanctuary was a figure or pattern\nof the heavenly, the law deposited in the ark on earth was an exact\ntranscript of the law in the ark in heaven; and that an acceptance of\nthe truth concerning the heavenly sanctuary involved an acknowledgment\nof the claims of God's law and the obligation of the Sabbath of the\nfourth commandment. Here was the secret of the bitter and determined\nopposition to the harmonious exposition of the Scriptures that revealed\nthe ministration of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. Men sought to\nclose the door which God had opened, and to open the door which He had\nclosed. But \"He that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no\nman openeth,\" had declared: \"Behold, I have set before thee an open\ndoor, and no man can shut it.\" \u00a0Revelation 3:7, 8. Christ had opened the\ndoor, or ministration, of the most holy place, light was shining from\nthat open door of the sanctuary in heaven, and the fourth commandment\nwas shown to be included in the law which is there enshrined; what God\nhad established, no man could overthrow. \u00a0{GC 435.1}",
                "Those who had accepted the light concerning the mediation of Christ and\nthe perpetuity of the law of God found that these were the truths\npresented in \u00a0Revelation 14. The messages of this chapter constitute a\nthreefold warning (see \u00a0Appendix) which is to prepare the inhabitants of\nthe earth for the Lord's second coming. The announcement, \"The hour of\nHis judgment is come,\" points to the closing work of Christ's\nministration for the salvation of men. It heralds a \u00a0truth which must be\nproclaimed until the Saviour's intercession shall cease and He shall\nreturn to the earth to take His people to Himself. The work of judgment\nwhich began in 1844 must continue until the cases of all are decided,\nboth of the living and the dead; hence it will extend to the close of\nhuman probation. That men may be prepared to stand in the judgment, the\nmessage commands them to \"fear God, and give glory to Him,\" \"and worship\nHim that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of\nwaters.\" The result of an acceptance of these messages is given in the\nword: \"Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of\nJesus.\" In order to be prepared for the judgment, it is necessary that\nmen should keep the law of God. That law will be the standard of\ncharacter in the judgment. The apostle Paul declares: \"As many as have\nsinned in the law shall be judged by the law, \\... in the day when God\nshall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.\" And he says that \"the\ndoers of the law shall be justified.\" \u00a0Romans 2:12-16. Faith is essential\nin order to the keeping of the law of God; for \"without faith it is\nimpossible to please Him.\" And \"whatsoever is not of faith is\nsin.\" \u00a0Hebrews 11:6; \u00a0Romans 14:23. \u00a0{GC 435.2}",
                "By the first angel, men are called upon to \"fear God, and give glory to\nHim\" and to worship Him as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. In\norder to do this, they must obey His law. Says the wise man: \"Fear God,\nand keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of\nman.\" \u00a0Ecclesiastes 12:13. Without obedience to His commandments no\nworship can be pleasing to God. \"This is the love of God, that we keep\nHis commandments.\" \"He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,\neven his prayer shall be abomination.\" \u00a01 John 5:3; \u00a0Proverbs 28:9. \u00a0{GC\n436.1}",
                "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the Creator\nand that to Him all other beings owe their existence. And wherever, in\nthe Bible, His claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the\nheathen, is presented, \u00a0there is cited the evidence of His creative\npower. \"All the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the\nheavens.\" \u00a0Psalm 96:5. \"To whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be\nequal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who\nhath created these things.\" \"Thus saith the Lord that created the\nheavens; God Himself that formed the earth and made it: \\... I am the\nLord; and there is none else.\" \u00a0Isaiah 40:25, 26; \u00a045:18.

And the holy beings\nwho worship God in heaven state, as the reason why their homage is due\nto Him: \"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power:\nfor Thou hast created all things.\" \u00a0Revelation 4:11. \u00a0{GC 436.2}",
                "In \u00a0Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Creator; and the\nprophecy brings to view a class that, as the result of the threefold\nmessage, are keeping the commandments of God. One of these commandments\npoints directly to God as the Creator. The fourth precept declares: \"The\nseventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: \\... for in six days the\nLord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested\nthe seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and\nhallowed it.\" \u00a0Exodus 20:10, 11. Concerning the Sabbath, the Lord says,\nfurther, that it is \"a sign, \\... that ye may know that I am the Lord\nyour God.\" \u00a0Ezekiel 20:20. And the reason given is: \"For in six days the\nLord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was\nrefreshed.\" \u00a0Exodus 31:17. \u00a0{GC 437.1}",
                "\"The importance of the Sabbath as the memorial of creation is that it\nkeeps ever present the true reason why worship is due to God\"---because\nHe is the Creator, and we are His creatures. \"The Sabbath therefore lies\nat the very foundation of divine worship, for it teaches this great\ntruth in the most impressive manner, and no other institution does this.\nThe true ground of divine worship, not of that on the seventh\nday \u00a0merely, but of all worship, is found in the distinction between the\nCreator and His creatures. This great fact can never become obsolete,\nand must never be forgotten.\"---J. N. Andrews, \u00a0*History of the\nSabbath,*chapter 27. It was to keep this truth ever before the minds of\nmen, that God instituted the Sabbath in Eden; and so long as the fact\nthat He is our Creator continues to be a reason why we should worship\nHim, so long the Sabbath will continue as its sign and memorial. Had the\nSabbath been universally kept, man's thoughts and affections would have\nbeen led to the Creator as the object of reverence and worship, and\nthere would never have been an idolater, an atheist, or an infidel. The\nkeeping of the Sabbath is a sign of loyalty to the true God, \"Him that\nmade heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\" It\nfollows that the message which commands men to worship God and keep His\ncommandments will especially call upon them to keep the fourth\ncommandment. \u00a0{GC 437.2}",
                "In contrast to those who keep the commandments of God and have the faith\nof Jesus, the third angel points to another class, against whose errors\na solemn and fearful warning is uttered: \"If any man worship the beast\nand his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the\nsame shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.\" \u00a0Revelation 14:9, 10.\nA correct interpretation of the symbols employed is necessary to an\nunderstanding of this message. What is represented by the beast, the\nimage, the mark? \u00a0{GC 438.1}",
                "The line of prophecy in which these symbols are found begins\nwith \u00a0Revelation 12, with the dragon that sought to destroy Christ at His\nbirth. The dragon is said to be Satan (Revelation 12:9); he it was that\nmoved upon Herod to put the Saviour to death. But the chief agent of\nSatan in making war upon Christ and His people during the first\ncenturies of the Christian Era was the Roman Empire, in which paganism\nwas the prevailing religion. Thus while the dragon, primarily,\nrepresents Satan, it is, in a secondary sense, a symbol of pagan\nRome. \u00a0{GC 438.2}",
                "In chapter 13 (verses 1-10) is described another beast, \"like unto a\nleopard,\" to which the dragon gave \"his power, and his seat, and great\nauthority.\" This symbol, as most Protestants have believed, represents\nthe papacy, which succeeded to the power and seat and authority once\nheld by the ancient Roman empire. Of the leopardlike beast it is\ndeclared: \"There was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and\nblasphemies\\.... And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to\nblaspheme His name, and His tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.\nAnd it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome\nthem: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and\nnations.\" This prophecy, which is nearly identical with the description\nof the little horn of \u00a0Daniel 7, unquestionably points to the papacy. \u00a0{GC\n439.1}",
                "\"Power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.\" And, says\nthe prophet, \"I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death.\" And\nagain: \"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that\nkilleth with the sword must be killed with the sword.\" The forty and two\nmonths are the same as the \"time and times and the dividing of time,\"\nthree years and a half, or 1260 days, of \u00a0Daniel 7 \u00a0- - the time during\nwhich the papal power was to oppress God's people. This period, as\nstated in preceding chapters, began with the supremacy of the papacy,\nA.D. 538, and terminated in 1798. At that time the pope was made captive\nby the French army, the papal power received its deadly wound, and the\nprediction was fulfilled, \"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into\ncaptivity.\" \u00a0{GC 439.2}",
                "At this point another symbol is introduced. Says the prophet: \"I beheld\nanother beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a\nlamb.\" \u00a0Verse 11. Both the appearance of this beast and the manner of its\nrise indicate that the nation which it represents is unlike those\npresented under the preceding symbols. The great kingdoms that have\nruled the world were presented to the prophet Daniel as \u00a0beasts of prey,\nrising when \"the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great\nsea.\" \u00a0Daniel 7:2. In \u00a0Revelation 17 \u00a0an angel explained that waters\nrepresent \"peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and\ntongues.\" \u00a0Revelation 17:15. Winds are a symbol of strife. The four winds\nof heaven striving upon the great sea represent the terrible scenes of\nconquest and revolution by which kingdoms have attained to power. \u00a0{GC\n439.3}",
                "But the beast with lamblike horns was seen \"coming up out of the earth.\"\nInstead of overthrowing other powers to establish itself, the nation\nthus represented must arise in territory previously unoccupied and grow\nup gradually and peacefully. It could not, then, arise among the crowded\nand struggling nationalities of the Old World---that turbulent sea of\n\"peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.\" It must be sought\nin the Western Continent. \u00a0{GC 440.1}",
                "What nation of the New World was in 1798 rising into power, giving\npromise of strength and greatness, and attracting the attention of the\nworld? The application of the symbol admits of no question. One nation,\nand only one, meets the specifications of this prophecy; it points\nunmistakably to the United States of America. Again and again the\nthought, almost the exact words, of the sacred writer has been\nunconsciously employed by the orator and the historian in describing the\nrise and growth of this nation. The beast was seen \"coming up out of the\nearth;\" and, according to the translators, the word here rendered\n\"coming up\" literally signifies \"to grow or spring up as a plant.\" And,\nas we have seen, the nation must arise in territory previously\nunoccupied. A prominent writer, describing the rise of the United\nStates, speaks of \u00a0*\"the mystery of her coming forth from vacancy,\"* \u00a0and\nsays: \"Like a \u00a0*silent seed* \u00a0we grew into empire.\"---G. A. Townsend, \u00a0*The\nNew World Compared With the Old,* \u00a0page 462.

Edward Everett, in an oration on \u00a0the\nPilgrim founders of this nation, said: \"Did they look for a retired\nspot, inoffensive for its obscurity, and safe in its remoteness, where\nthe little church of Leyden might enjoy the freedom of conscience?\nBehold the \u00a0*mighty regions* \u00a0over which, in \u00a0*peaceful conquest,* \u00a0\\...\nthey have borne the banners of the cross!\"---Speech delivered at\nPlymouth, Massachusetts, Dec. 22, 1824, page 11. \u00a0{GC 440.2}",
                "\"And he had two horns like a lamb.\" The lamblike horns indicate youth,\ninnocence, and gentleness, fitly representing the character of the\nUnited States when presented to the prophet as \"coming up\" in 1798.\nAmong the Christian exiles who first fled to America and sought an\nasylum from royal oppression and priestly intolerance were many who\ndetermined to establish a government upon the broad foundation of civil\nand religious liberty. Their views found place in the Declaration of\nIndependence, which sets forth the great truth that \"all men are created\nequal\" and endowed with the inalienable right to \"life, liberty, and the\npursuit of happiness.\" And the Constitution guarantees to the people the\nright of self-government, providing that representatives elected by the\npopular vote shall enact and administer the laws. Freedom of religious\nfaith was also granted, every man being permitted to worship God\naccording to the dictates of his conscience. Republicanism and\nProtestantism became the fundamental principles of the nation. These\nprinciples are the secret of its power and prosperity. The oppressed and\ndowntrodden throughout Christendom have turned to this land with\ninterest and hope. Millions have sought its shores, and the United\nStates has risen to a place among the most powerful nations of the\nearth. \u00a0{GC 441.1}",

                "The lamblike horns and dragon voice of the symbol point to a striking\ncontradiction between the professions and the practice of the nation\nthus represented. The \"speaking\" of the nation is the action of its\nlegislative and judicial authorities. By such action it will give the\nlie to those liberal and peaceful principles which it has put forth as\nthe foundation of its policy. The prediction that it will speak \"as a\ndragon\" and exercise \"all the power of the first beast\" plainly\nforetells a development of the spirit of intolerance and persecution\nthat was manifested by the nations represented by the dragon and the\nleopardlike beast. And the statement that the beast with two horns\n\"causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first\nbeast\" indicates that the authority of this nation is to be exercised in\nenforcing some observance which shall be an act of homage to the\npapacy. \u00a0{GC 442.1}",

The Constitution\nprovides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" and that \"no\nreligious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office\nor public trust under the United States.\" Only in flagrant violation of\nthese safeguards to the nation's liberty, can any religious observance\nbe enforced by civil authority.

                "Whenever the church has obtained secular power, she has employed it to\npunish dissent from her doctrines.

An\nexample of this is given in the long-continued persecution of dissenters\nby the Church of England. During the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies, thousands of nonconformist ministers were forced to flee from\ntheir churches, and many, both of pastors and people, were subjected to\nfine, imprisonment, torture, and martyrdom. \u00a0{GC 443.3}",

As men see that they cannot maintain\ntheir position by the Scriptures, many determine to maintain it at all\nhazards, and with a malicious spirit they assail the character and\nmotives of those who stand in defense of unpopular truth. It is the same\npolicy which has been pursued in all ages. Elijah was declared to be a\ntroubler in Israel, Jeremiah a traitor, Paul a polluter of the temple.\nFrom that day to this, those who would be loyal to truth have been\ndenounced as seditious, \u00a0heretical, or schismatic. Multitudes who are too\nunbelieving to accept the sure word of prophecy will receive with\nunquestioning credulity an accusation against those who dare to reprove\nfashionable sins. This spirit will increase more and more.

The \"light which lighteth every man that\ncometh into the world\" illumined the secret chambers of their souls, and\nthe hidden things of darkness were made manifest. Deep conviction took\nhold upon their minds and hearts. They were convinced of sin and of\nrighteousness and of judgment to come. They had a sense of the\nrighteousness of Jehovah and felt the terror of appearing, in their\nguilt and uncleanness, before the Searcher of hearts. In anguish they\ncried out: \"Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\" As the\ncross of Calvary, with its infinite sacrifice for the sins of men, was\nrevealed, they saw that nothing but the merits of Christ could suffice\nto atone for their transgressions; this alone could reconcile man to\nGod. With faith and humility they accepted the Lamb of God, that taketh\naway the sin of the world. Through the blood of Jesus they had\n\"remission of sins that are past.\" \u00a0{GC 461.1}",

The things\nthey once hated they now loved, and the things they once loved they\nhated. The proud and self-assertive became meek and lowly of heart. The\nvain and supercilious became serious and unobtrusive. The profane became\nreverent, the drunken sober, and the profligate pure. The vain fashions\nof the world were laid aside. Christians sought not the \"outward\nadorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on\nof apparel; but \\... the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not\ncorruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in\nthe sight of God of great price.\" \u00a01 Peter 3:3, 4. \u00a0{GC 461.2}",
                "Revivals brought deep heart-searching and humility. They were\ncharacterized by solemn, earnest appeals to the sinner, by yearning\ncompassion for the purchase of the blood of Christ. Men and women prayed\nand wrestled with God for the salvation of souls. The fruits of such\nrevivals were seen in souls who shrank not at self-denial and sacrifice,\nbut rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer reproach and trial\nfor the sake of Christ.

Unless\na religious service has something of a sensational character, it has no\nattractions for them. A message which appeals to unimpassioned reason\nawakens no response. The plain warnings of God's word, relating directly\nto their eternal interests, are unheeded. \u00a0{GC 463.2}",
                "With every truly converted soul the relation to God and to eternal\nthings will be the great topic of life. But where, in the popular\nchurches of today, is the spirit of consecration to God? The converts do\nnot renounce their pride and love of the world. They are no more willing\nto deny self, to take up the cross, and follow the meek and lowly Jesus,\nthan before their conversion. Religion has become the sport of infidels\nand skeptics because so many who bear its name are ignorant of its\nprinciples. The power of godliness has well-nigh departed from many of\nthe churches. Picnics, church theatricals, \u00a0church fairs, fine houses,\npersonal display, have banished thoughts of God.

Before the final visitation\nof God's judgments upon the earth there will be among the people of the\nLord such a revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed\nsince apostolic times. The Spirit and power of God will be poured out\nupon His children. At that time many will separate themselves from those\nchurches in which the love of this world has supplanted love for God and\nHis word. Many, both of ministers and people, will gladly accept those\ngreat truths which God has caused to be proclaimed at this time to\nprepare a people for the Lord's second coming. The enemy of souls\ndesires to hinder this work; and before the time for such a movement\nshall come, he will endeavor to prevent it by introducing a counterfeit.\nIn those churches which he can bring under his deceptive power he will\nmake it appear that God's special blessing is poured out; there will be\nmanifest what is thought to be great religious interest.

There is an emotional excitement, a mingling of the true with\nthe false, that is well adapted to mislead. Yet none need be deceived.\nIn the light of God's word it is not difficult to determine the nature\nof these movements. Wherever men neglect the testimony of the Bible,\nturning away from those plain, soul-testing truths which require\nself-denial and renunciation of the world, there we may be sure that\nGod's blessing is not bestowed. \u00a0And by the rule which Christ Himself has\ngiven, \"Ye shall know them by their fruits\" (Matthew 7:16), it is\nevident that these movements are not the work of the Spirit of God. \u00a0{GC\n464.2}",
                "In the truths of His word, God has given to men a revelation of Himself;\nand to all who accept them they are a shield against the deceptions of\nSatan. It is a neglect of these truths that has opened the door to the\nevils which are now becoming so widespread in the religious world. The\nnature and the importance of the law of God have been, to a great\nextent, lost sight of. A wrong conception of the character, the\nperpetuity, and the obligation of the divine law has led to errors in\nrelation to conversion and sanctification, and has resulted in lowering\nthe standard of piety in the church. Here is to be found the secret of\nthe lack of the Spirit and power of God in the revivals of our time. \u00a0{GC\n465.1}",
                "There are, in the various denominations, men eminent for their piety, by\nwhom this fact is acknowledged and deplored. Professor Edwards A. Park,\nin setting forth the current religious perils, ably says: \"One source of\ndanger is the neglect of the pulpit to enforce the divine law. In former\ndays the pulpit was an echo of the voice of conscience\\.... Our most\nillustrious preachers gave a wonderful majesty to their discourses by\nfollowing the example of the Master, and giving prominence to the law,\nits precepts, and its threatenings. They repeated the two great maxims,\nthat the law is a transcript of the divine perfections, and that a man\nwho does not love the law does not love the gospel; for the law, as well\nas the gospel, is a mirror reflecting the true character of God. This\nperil leads to another, that of underrating the evil of sin, the extent\nof it, the demerit of it. In proportion to the rightfulness of the\ncommandment is the wrongfulness of disobeying it\\.... \u00a0{GC 465.2}",
                "\"Affiliated to the dangers already named is the danger of\nunderestimating the justice of God. The tendency of the modern pulpit is\nto strain out the divine justice from the divine benevolence, to sink\nbenevolence into a sentiment rather \u00a0than exalt it into a principle. The\nnew theological prism puts asunder what God has joined together. Is the\ndivine law a good or an evil? It is a good. Then justice is good; for it\nis a disposition to execute the law. From the habit of underrating the\ndivine law and justice, the extent and demerit of human disobedience,\nmen easily slide into the habit of underestimating the grace which has\nprovided an atonement for sin.\" Thus the gospel loses its value and\nimportance in the minds of men, and soon they are ready practically to\ncast aside the Bible itself. \u00a0{GC 465.3}",
                "Many religious teachers assert that Christ by His death abolished the\nlaw, and men are henceforth free from its requirements.

And the apostle Paul declares: \"The\nlaw is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\" \u00a0Romans 7:12.\nSuch a law, being an expression of the mind and will of God, must be as\nenduring as its Author. \u00a0{GC 467.1}",
                "It is the work of conversion and sanctification to reconcile men to God\nby bringing them into accord with the principles of His law. In the\nbeginning, man was created in the image of God. He was in perfect\nharmony with the nature and the law of God; the principles of\nrighteousness were written upon his heart. But sin alienated him from\nhis Maker. He no longer reflected the divine image. His heart was at war\nwith the principles of God's law. \"The carnal mind is enmity against\nGod: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can\nbe.\" \u00a0Romans 8:7. But \"God so loved the world, that He gave His\nonly-begotten Son,\" that man might be reconciled to God. Through the\nmerits of Christ he can be restored to harmony with his Maker.

                "The first step in reconciliation to God is the conviction of sin. \"Sin\nis the transgression of the law.\" \"By the law is the knowledge of\nsin.\" \u00a01 John 3:4; \u00a0Romans 3:20. In order to see his guilt, the sinner\nmust test his character by God's great standard of righteousness. It is\na mirror which shows the perfection of a righteous character and enables\nhim to discern the defects in his own. \u00a0{GC 467.3}",
                "The law reveals to man his sins, but it provides no remedy. \u00a0While it\npromises life to the obedient, it declares that death is the portion of\nthe transgressor. The gospel of Christ alone can free him from the\ncondemnation or the defilement of sin. He must exercise repentance\ntoward God, whose law has been transgressed; and faith in Christ, his\natoning sacrifice. Thus he obtains \"remission of sins that are past\" and\nbecomes a partaker of the divine nature. He is a child of God, having\nreceived the spirit of adoption, whereby he cries: \"Abba, Father!\" \u00a0{GC\n467.4}",

In the\nnew birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as it is brought\ninto accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken place in the\nsinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness, from\ntransgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty. The old life of\nalienation from God has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith\nand love, has begun.

Christ is a perfect example of such a\ncharacter. He says: \"I have kept My Father's commandments.\" \"I do always\nthose things that please Him.\" \u00a0John 15:10; \u00a08:29.

                "With the earliest history of man, Satan began his efforts to deceive our\nrace. He who had incited rebellion in heaven desired to bring the\ninhabitants of the earth to unite with him in his warfare against the\ngovernment of God. Adam and Eve had been perfectly happy in obedience to\nthe law of God, and this fact was a constant testimony against the claim\nwhich Satan had urged in heaven, that God's law was oppressive and\nopposed to the good of His creatures. And furthermore, Satan's envy was\nexcited as he looked upon the beautiful home prepared for the sinless\npair. He determined to cause their fall, that, having separated them\nfrom God and brought them under his own power, he might gain possession\nof the earth and here establish his kingdom in opposition to the Most\nHigh. \u00a0{GC 531.1}",
                "Had Satan revealed himself in his real character, he would have been\nrepulsed at once, for Adam and Eve had been warned against this\ndangerous foe; but he worked in the dark, concealing his purpose, that\nhe might more effectually accomplish his object. Employing as his medium\nthe serpent, then a creature of fascinating appearance, he addressed\nhimself to Eve: \"Hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the\ngarden?\" \u00a0Genesis 3:1. Had Eve refrained from entering into argument with\nthe tempter, she would have been safe; but she ventured to parley with\nhim and fell a victim to his \u00a0wiles. It is thus that many are still\novercome. They doubt and argue concerning the requirements of God; and\ninstead of obeying the divine commands, they accept human theories,\nwhich but disguise the devices of Satan. \u00a0{GC 531.2}",
                "\"The woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees\nof the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the\ngarden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch\nit, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not\nsurely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your\neyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and\nevil.\" \u00a0Verses 2-5. He declared that they would become like God,\npossessing greater wisdom than before and being capable of a higher\nstate of existence. Eve yielded to temptation; and through her\ninfluence, Adam was led into sin. They accepted the words of the\nserpent, that God did not mean what He said; they distrusted their\nCreator and imagined that He was restricting their liberty and that they\nmight obtain great wisdom and exaltation by transgressing His law. \u00a0{GC\n532.1}",

Then indeed there was great good\nto be gained by transgression, and Satan was proved to be a benefactor\nof the race. But Adam did not find this to be the meaning of the divine\nsentence. God declared that as a penalty for his sin, man should return\nto the ground whence he was taken: \"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt\nthou return.\" \u00a0Verse 19. The words of Satan, \"Your eyes shall be opened,\"\nproved to be true in this sense only: After Adam and Eve had disobeyed\nGod, their eyes were opened to discern their folly; they did know evil,\nand they tasted the bitter fruit of transgression. \u00a0{GC 532.2}",

While \"death passed upon all men, for\nthat all have sinned,\" Christ \"hath brought life and immortality to\nlight through the gospel.\" \u00a0Romans 5:12; \u00a02 Timothy 1:10.

The divine sentence, \"The soul that sinneth, it shall\ndie\" (Ezekiel 18:20), is made to mean: The soul that sinneth, it shall\nnot die, but live eternally.

Yet\nthis doctrine has been widely taught and is still embodied in many of\nthe creeds of Christendom.

When\nthey see others who are of the same nature and born under the same\ncircumstances, plunged in such misery, and they so distinguished, it\nwill make them sensible of how happy they are.\" Another used these\nwords: \"While the decree of reprobation is eternally executing on the\nvessels of wrath, the smoke of their torment will be eternally ascending\nin view of the vessels of mercy, who, instead of taking the part of\nthese miserable objects, will say, Amen, Alleluia! praise ye the\nLord!\" \u00a0{GC 535.1}",

It is urged that the infliction of endless misery upon the wicked\nwould show God's hatred of sin as an evil which is ruinous to the peace\nand order of the universe. Oh, dreadful blasphemy! As if God's hatred of\nsin is the reason why it is perpetuated. For, according to the teachings\nof these theologians, continued torture without hope of mercy maddens\nits wretched victims, and as they pour out their rage in curses and\nblasphemy, they are forever augmenting their load of guilt.

True, it has been taught by great and good men; but the\nlight on this subject had not come to them as it has come to us. They\nwere responsible only for the light which shone in their time; we are\naccountable for that which shines in our day.

But\nholding that the soul is naturally immortal, they see no alternative but\nto conclude that all mankind will finally be saved. Many regard the\nthreatenings of the Bible as designed merely to frighten men into\nobedience, and not to be literally fulfilled. Thus the sinner can live\nin selfish pleasure, disregarding the requirements of God, and yet\nexpect to be finally received into His favor.

If, as taught by popular theologians,\nspirits of the dead are hovering about their friends on earth, why\nshould they not be permitted to communicate with them, to warn them\nagainst evil, or to comfort \u00a0them in sorrow? How can those who believe in\nman's consciousness in death reject what comes to them as divine light\ncommunicated by glorified spirits? Here is a channel regarded as sacred,\nthrough which Satan works for the accomplishment of his purposes. The\nfallen angels who do his bidding appear as messengers from the spirit\nworld.

The people\nof God are directed to the Scriptures as their safeguard against the\ninfluence of false teachers and the delusive power of spirits of\ndarkness. Satan employs every possible device to prevent men from\nobtaining a knowledge of the Bible; for its plain utterances reveal his\ndeceptions. At every revival of God's work the prince of evil is aroused\nto more intense activity; he is now putting forth his utmost efforts for\na final struggle against Christ and His followers. The last great\ndelusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist is to perform his\nmarvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeit resemble\nthe true that it will be impossible to distinguish between them except\nby the Holy Scriptures. By their testimony every statement and every\nmiracle must be tested. \u00a0{GC 593.1}",

To every soul will come the\nsearching test: Shall I obey God rather than men? The decisive hour is\neven now at hand. Are our feet planted on the rock of God's immutable\nword?

The words which they needed to remember\nwere banished from their minds; and when the time of trial came, it\nfound them unprepared. The death of Jesus as fully destroyed their hopes\nas if He had not forewarned them.

The events connected with the close of probation and\nthe work of preparation for the time of trouble, are clearly presented.\nBut multitudes have no more understanding of these important truths than\nif they had never been revealed.

But since many refuse to be satisfied\nwith the mere authority of men and demand a plain \"Thus saith the Lord,\"\nthe popular ministry, like the Pharisees of old, filled with anger as\ntheir authority is questioned, will denounce the message as of Satan and\nstir up the sin-loving multitudes to revile and persecute those who\nproclaim it. \u00a0{GC 606.2}",

By every means at their command they will\nendeavor to suppress the discussion of these vital questions. The church\nappeals to the strong arm of civil power, and, in this work, papists and\nProtestants unite. As the movement for Sunday enforcement becomes more\nbold and decided, the law will be invoked against commandment keepers.\nThey will be threatened with fines and imprisonment, and some will be\noffered positions of influence, and other rewards and advantages, as\ninducements to renounce their faith.

Those who are arraigned before\nthe courts make a strong vindication of the truth, and some who hear\nthem are led to take their stand to keep all the commandments of God.\nThus light will be brought before thousands who otherwise would know\nnothing of these truths. \u00a0{GC 607.1}",

The words of Paul will be\nliterally fulfilled: \"All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall\nsuffer persecution.\" \u00a02 Timothy 3:12. As the defenders of truth refuse to\nhonor the Sunday-sabbath, some of them will be thrust into prison, some\nwill be exiled, some will be treated as slaves.

For eyewitness accounts of\nreligious days in Ethiopia, see Pero Gomes de Teixeira, \u00a0*The Discovery\nof Abyssinia by the Portuguese in 1520* \u00a0(translated in English in\nLondon: British Museum, 1938), p. 79; Father Francisco\nAlvarez, \u00a0*Narrative of the Portuguese Embassy to Abyssinia During the\nYears 1520-1527,* \u00a0in the records of the Hakluyt Society (London, 1881),\nvol. 64, pp. 22-49; Michael Russell, \u00a0*Nubia and Abyssinia* \u00a0(Quoting\nFather Lobo, Catholic Missionary in Ethiopia in 1622) (New York: Harper\n& Brothers, 1837), pp. 226-229; S.
