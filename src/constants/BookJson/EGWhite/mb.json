In vain had John\nthe Baptist, with the heart-searching power of the ancient prophets,\ncalled them to repentance.

If you have renounced self and given yourself to\nChrist you are a member of the family of God, and everything in the\nFather's house is for you.

For as\nthe heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your\nways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.\" \u00a0Isaiah 55:7-9.

In summer these streams often \u00a0wholly disappeared,\nleaving only a dry and dusty channel. But when the wintry storms burst\nupon the hills, the rivers became fierce, raging torrents, at times\noverspreading the valleys and bearing everything away on their\nresistless flood. Often, then, the hovels reared by the peasants on the\ngrassy plain, apparently beyond the reach of danger, were swept away.\nBut high upon the hills were houses built upon the rock. In some parts\nof the land were dwellings built wholly of rock, and many of them had\nwithstood the tempests of a thousand years. These houses were reared\nwith toil and difficulty.

This\nalone would not bring them into possession of the vineyards and olive\ngroves of the goodly land.
