All created things,\nin their original perfection, were an expression\u00c2\u00a0of the thought of God.\nTo Adam and Eve nature was teeming with divine wisdom. But by\ntransgression man was cut off from learning of God through direct\ncommunion and, to a great degree, through His works.

Upon every page of the\ngreat volume of His created works may still be traced His handwriting.\nNature still speaks of her Creator. Yet these revelations are partial\nand imperfect.

It is the work of true education to develop this power, to\ntrain the youth to be thinkers, and not mere reflectors of other men's\nthought. Instead of confining their study to that which men have said or\nwritten, let students be directed to the sources of truth, to the vast\nfields opened for research in nature and revelation.

Thus not only\nthe life of man,\u00c2\u00a0but the nature of the beasts, the trees of the forest,\nthe grass of the field, the very air he breathed, all told the sad\nlesson of the knowledge of evil.\u00c2\u00a0{Ed 26.4}",

                "This intimation also nature repeats to us. Though marred by sin, it\nspeaks not only of creation but of redemption. Though the earth bears\ntestimony to the curse in the evident signs of decay, it is still rich\nand beautiful in the tokens of life-giving power. The trees cast off\ntheir leaves, only to be robed with fresher verdure; the flowers die, to\nspring forth in new beauty; and in every manifestation of creative power\nis held out the assurance that we may be created anew in \"righteousness\nand holiness of truth.\"\u00c2\u00a0Ephesians 4:24, margin.

But in very many households the\ntraining appointed by Heaven, and the characters thus developed, were\nalike rare. God's plan was but partially and imperfectly fulfilled. By\nunbelief and by disregard of the Lord's directions, the Israelites\nsurrounded themselves with temptations that few had power to resist. At\ntheir settlement in Canaan \"they did not destroy the nations, concerning\nwhom the Lord commanded them: but were mingled among the heathen, and\nlearned their works. And they served their idols: which were a snare\nunto them.\" Their heart was not right with God, \"neither were they\nsteadfast in His covenant. But He, being full of compassion, forgave\ntheir iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned He His\nanger away\\.... For He remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that\npasseth away, and cometh not again.\"\u00c2\u00a0Psalm 106:34-36;\u00c2\u00a078:37-39. Fathers\nand mothers in Israel became indifferent to their obligation to God,\nindifferent to their obligation to their children. Through\nunfaithfulness in the home, and idolatrous influences without, many of\nthe Hebrew youth received an education differing widely\u00c2\u00a0from that which\nGod had planned for them. They learned the ways of the heathen.\u00c2\u00a0{Ed\n45.1}",
                "To meet this growing evil, God provided other agencies as an aid to\nparents in the work of education. From the earliest times, prophets had\nbeen recognized as teachers divinely appointed. In the highest sense the\nprophet was one who spoke by direct inspiration, communicating to the\npeople the messages he had received from God. But the name was given\nalso to those who, though not so directly inspired, were divinely called\nto instruct the people in the works and ways of God. For the training of\nsuch a class of teachers, Samuel, by the Lord's direction, established\nthe schools of the prophets.\u00c2\u00a0{Ed 46.1}",

To this end, Samuel gathered companies of young men who\nwere pious, intelligent, and studious. These were called the sons of the\nprophets. As they studied the word and the works of God, His life-giving\npower quickened the energies of mind and soul, and the students received\nwisdom from above. The instructors were not only versed in divine truth,\nbut had themselves enjoyed communion with God, and had received the\nspecial endowment of His Spirit. They had the respect and confidence of\nthe people, both for learning and for piety. In Samuel's day there were\ntwo of these schools---one at Ramah, the home of the prophet, and the\nother at Kirjath-jearim. In later times others were established.\u00c2\u00a0{Ed\n46.2}",
                "The pupils of these schools sustained themselves by their own labor in\ntilling the soil or in some mechanical employment. In Israel this was\nnot thought strange or degrading; indeed, it was regarded as a sin to\nallow children to grow up in ignorance of useful labor. Every youth,\nwhether his parents were rich or poor, was taught some trade. Even\nthough he was to be educated for holy office, a knowledge of practical\nlife was regarded as essential to the greatest usefulness. Many, also,\nof the teachers supported themselves by manual labor.\u00c2\u00a0{Ed 47.1}",
                "In both the school and the home much of the teaching was oral; but the\nyouth also learned to read the Hebrew writings, and the parchment rolls\nof the Old Testament Scriptures were open to their study. The chief\nsubjects of study in these schools were the law of God, with the\ninstruction given to Moses, sacred history, sacred music, and poetry. In\nthe records of sacred history were traced the footsteps of Jehovah. The\ngreat truths set forth by the types in the service of the sanctuary were\nbrought to view, and faith grasped the central object of all that\nsystem---the Lamb of God, that was to take away the sin of the world. A\nspirit of devotion was cherished. Not only were the students taught the\nduty of prayer, but they were taught how to pray, how to approach their\nCreator, how to exercise faith in Him, and how to understand and obey\nthe teachings of His Spirit. Sanctified intellect brought forth from the\ntreasure house of God things new and old, and the Spirit of God was\nmanifested in prophecy and sacred song.\u00c2\u00a0{Ed 47.2}",

It\nwas this that caused the Lord to pronounce David, when in his youth He\ncalled him to the throne, \"a man after Mine own heart.\"\u00c2\u00a0Acts 13:22.\u00c2\u00a0{Ed\n48.1}",
                "In the early life of Solomon also are seen the results of God's method\nof education. Solomon in his youth made David's choice his own. Above\nevery earthly good he asked of God a wise and understanding heart. And\nthe Lord gave him not only that which he sought, but that also for which\nhe had not sought---both riches and honor. The power of his\nunderstanding, the extent of his knowledge, the glory of his reign,\nbecame the wonder of the world.\u00c2\u00a0{Ed 48.2}",
                "In the reigns of David and Solomon, Israel reached the height of her\ngreatness. The promise given to Abraham and repeated through Moses was\nfulfilled: \"If ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I\ncommand you, to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His\nways, and to cleave unto Him; then will the Lord drive out all these\nnations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and\nmightier than yourselves.

The sin of David's later\nyears, though sincerely repented of and\u00c2\u00a0sorely punished, emboldened the\npeople in transgression of God's commandments. And Solomon's life, after\na morning of so great promise, was darkened with apostasy. Desire for\npolitical power and self-aggrandizement led to alliance with heathen\nnations. The silver of Tarshish and the gold of Ophir were procured by\nthe sacrifice of integrity, the betrayal of sacred trusts. Association\nwith idolaters, marriage with heathen wives, corrupted his faith. The\nbarriers that God had erected for the safety of His people were thus\nbroken down, and Solomon gave himself up to the worship of false gods.\nOn the summit of the Mount of Olives, confronting the temple of Jehovah,\nwere erected gigantic images and altars for the service of heathen\ndeities. As he cast off his allegiance to God, Solomon lost the mastery\nof himself. His fine sensibilities became blunted. The conscientious,\nconsiderate spirit of his early reign was changed. Pride, ambition,\nprodigality, and indulgence bore fruit in cruelty and exaction. He who\nhad been a just, compassionate, and God-fearing ruler, became tyrannical\nand oppressive. He who at the dedication of the temple had prayed for\nhis people that their hearts might be undividedly given to the Lord,\nbecame their seducer. Solomon dishonored himself, dishonored Israel, and\ndishonored God.\u00c2\u00a0{Ed 48.4}",

The discipline and training that God appointed for\nIsrael would cause them, in all their ways of life, to differ from the\npeople of other nations. This peculiarity, which should have been\nregarded as a special privilege and blessing, was to them unwelcome. The\nsimplicity and self-restraint essential to the highest development they\nsought\u00c2\u00a0to exchange for the pomp and self-indulgence of heathen peoples.\nTo be \"like all the nations\" (1 Samuel 8:5) was their ambition.

The worship of God \"in Spirit and in truth\" had been\nsupplanted by the glorification of men in an endless round of man-made\nceremonies.

The lower classes regarded the\u00c2\u00a0Supreme\nBeing as one scarcely differing from their oppressors, save by exceeding\nthem in power. By these ideas every form of religion was molded.
