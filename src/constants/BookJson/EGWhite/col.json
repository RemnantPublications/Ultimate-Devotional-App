                "Christ the Great Teacher gave much of His instruction as He walked with\nHis disciples through the hills and valleys of Palestine or rested by\nthe lake or river. In His parable teaching He linked divine truth with\ncommon things and incidents, as may be found in the experiences of the\nshepherd, the builder, the tiller of the soil, the traveler, and the\nhomemaker. Familiar objects were associated with thoughts true and\nbeautiful---thoughts of God's loving interest in us, of the grateful\nhomage that is his due, and of the care we should have one for another.\nThus lessons of divine wisdom and practical truth were made forcible and\nimpressive. \u00a0{COL 7.1}",

                "In Christ's parable teaching the same principle is seen as in His own\nmission to the world. That we might become acquainted with His divine\ncharacter and life, Christ took our nature and dwelt among us. Divinity\nwas revealed in humanity; the invisible glory in the visible human form.\nMen could learn of the unknown through the known; heavenly things were\nrevealed through the earthly; God was made manifest in the likeness of\nmen. So it was in Christ's teaching: the unknown was illustrated by the\nknown; divine truths by earthly things with which the people were most\nfamiliar. \u00a0{COL 17.1}",
                "The Scripture says, \"All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in\nparables; \\... that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the\nprophet, saying, I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things\nwhich have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.\" \u00a0Matthew\n13:34, 35. Natural things were the medium for the spiritual; the things\nof nature and the life-experience of His hearers were connected with the\ntruths of the written word. Leading thus from the natural to the\nspiritual kingdom, Christ's parables \u00a0are links in the chain of truth\nthat unites man with God, and earth with heaven. \u00a0{COL 17.2}",
                "In His teaching from nature, Christ was speaking of the things which His\nown hands had made, and which had qualities and powers that He Himself\nhad imparted. In their original perfection all created things were an\nexpression of the thought of God. To Adam and Eve in their Eden home\nnature was full of the knowledge of God, teeming with divine\ninstruction. Wisdom spoke to the eye and was received into the heart;\nfor they communed with God in His created works. As soon as the holy\npair transgressed the law of the Most High, the brightness from the face\nof God departed from the face of nature. The earth is now marred and\ndefiled by sin. Yet even in its blighted state much that is beautiful\nremains. God's object lessons are not obliterated; rightly understood,\nnature speaks of her Creator. \u00a0{COL 18.1}",
                "In the days of Christ these lessons had been lost sight of. Men had\nwell-nigh ceased to discern God in His works. The sinfulness of humanity\nhad cast a pall over the fair face of creation; and instead of\nmanifesting God, His works became a barrier that concealed Him. Men\n\"worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator.\" Thus the\nheathen \"became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was\ndarkened.\" \u00a0Romans 1:25, 21. So in Israel, man's teaching had been put in\nthe place of God's. Not only the things of nature, but the sacrificial\nservice and the Scriptures themselves---all given to reveal God---were\nso perverted that they became the means of concealing Him. \u00a0{COL 18.2}",
                "Christ sought to remove that which obscured the truth. The veil that sin\nhas cast over the face of nature, He came \u00a0to draw aside, bringing to\nview the spiritual glory that all things were created to reflect. His\nwords placed the teachings of nature as well as of the Bible in a new\naspect, and made them a new revelation. \u00a0{COL 18.3}",
                "Jesus plucked the beautiful lily, and placed it in the hands of children\nand youth; and as they looked into His own youthful face, fresh with the\nsunlight of His Father's countenance, He gave the lesson, \"Consider the\nlilies of the field, how they grow \\[in the simplicity of natural\nbeauty\\]; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you,\nthat even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\"\nThen followed the sweet assurance and the important lesson, \"Wherefore,\nif God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is\ncast into the oven, shall He not much more clothe you, O ye of little\nfaith?\" \u00a0{COL 19.1}",
                "In the sermon on the mount these words were spoken to others besides\nchildren and youth. They were spoken to the multitude, among whom were\nmen and women full of worries and perplexities, and sore with\ndisappointment and sorrow. Jesus continued: \"Therefore take no thought,\nsaying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal\nshall we be clothed? (for after all these things do the Gentiles seek:)\nfor your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\"\nThen spreading out His hands to the surrounding multitude, He said, \"But\nseek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these\nthings shall be added unto you.\" \u00a0Matthew 6:28-33. \u00a0{COL 19.2}",
                "Thus Christ interpreted the message which He Himself had given to the\nlilies and the grass of the field. He desires us to read it in every\nlily and every spire of grass. His words are full of assurance, and tend\nto confirm trust in God. \u00a0{COL 19.3}",
                "So wide was Christ's view of truth, so extended His teaching, that every\nphase of nature was employed in illustrating truth. The scenes upon\nwhich the eye daily rests were all connected with some spiritual truth,\nso that nature is clothed with the parables of the Master. \u00a0{COL 20.1}",
                "In the earlier part of His ministry, Christ had spoken to the people in\nwords so plain that all His hearers might have grasped truths which\nwould make them wise unto salvation. But in many hearts the truth had\ntaken no root, and it had been quickly caught away. \"Therefore speak I\nto them in parables,\" He said; \"because they seeing see not; and hearing\nthey hear not, neither do they understand\\.... For this people's heart\nis waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they\nhave closed.\" \u00a0Matthew 13:13-15. \u00a0{COL 20.2}",
                "Jesus desired to awaken inquiry. He sought to arouse \u00a0the careless, and\nimpress truth upon the heart. Parable teaching was popular, and\ncommanded the respect and attention, not only of the Jews, but of the\npeople of other nations. No more effective method of instruction could\nHe have employed. If His hearers had desired a knowledge of divine\nthings, they might have understood His words; for He was always willing\nto explain them to the honest inquirer. \u00a0{COL 20.3}",
                "Again, Christ had truths to present which the people were unprepared to\naccept or even to understand. For this reason also He taught them in\nparables. By connecting His teaching with the scenes of life,\nexperience, or nature, He secured their attention and impressed their\nhearts. Afterward, as they looked upon the objects that illustrated His\nlessons, they recalled the words of the divine Teacher. To minds that\nwere open to the Holy Spirit, the significance of the Saviour's teaching\nunfolded more and more. Mysteries grew clear, and that which had been\nhard to grasp became evident. \u00a0{COL 21.1}",
                "Jesus sought an avenue to every heart. By using a variety of\nillustrations, He not only presented truth in its different phases, but\nappealed to the different hearers. Their interest was aroused by figures\ndrawn from the surroundings of their daily life. None who listened to\nthe \u00a0Saviour could feel that they were neglected or forgotten. The\nhumblest, the most sinful, heard in His teaching a voice that spoke to\nthem in sympathy and tenderness. \u00a0{COL 21.2}",
                "And He had another reason for teaching in parables. Among the multitudes\nthat gathered about Him, there were priests and rabbis, scribes and\nelders, Herodians and rulers, world-loving, bigoted, ambitious men, who\ndesired above all things to find some accusation against Him. Their\nspies followed His steps day after day, to catch from His lips something\nthat would cause His condemnation, and forever silence the One who\nseemed to draw the world after Him. The Saviour understood the character\nof these men, and He presented truth in such a way that they could find\nnothing by which to bring His case before the Sanhedrin. In parables He\nrebuked the hypocrisy and wicked works of those who occupied high\npositions, and in figurative language clothed truth of so cutting a\ncharacter that had it been spoken in direct denunciation, they would not\nhave listened to His words, and would speedily have put an end to His\nministry. But while He evaded the spies, He made truth so clear that\nerror was manifested, and the honest in heart were profited by His\nlessons. Divine wisdom, infinite grace, were made plain by the things of\nGod's creation. Through nature and the experiences of life, men were\ntaught of God. \"The invisible things of Him since the creation of the\nworld,\" were \"perceived through the things that are made, even His\neverlasting power and divinity.\" \u00a0Romans 1:20, R. V. \u00a0{COL 22.1}",
                "In the Saviour's parable teaching is an indication of what constitutes\nthe true \"higher education.\" Christ might have opened to men the deepest\ntruths of science. He might have unlocked mysteries which have required\nmany centuries of toil and study to penetrate. He might have made\nsuggestions in scientific lines that would have \u00a0afforded food for\nthought and stimulus for invention to the close of time. But He did not\ndo this. He said nothing to gratify curiosity, or to satisfy man's\nambition by opening doors to worldly greatness. In all His teaching,\nChrist brought the mind of man in contact with the Infinite Mind. He did\nnot direct the people to study men's theories about God, His word, or\nHis works. He taught them to behold Him as manifested in His works, in\nHis word, and by His providences. \u00a0{COL 22.2}",
                "Christ did not deal in abstract theories, but in that which is essential\nto the development of character, that which will enlarge man's capacity\nfor knowing God, and increase his efficiency to do good. He spoke to men\nof those truths that relate to the conduct of life, and that take hold\nupon eternity. \u00a0{COL 23.1}",
                "It was Christ who directed the education of Israel. Concerning the\ncommandments and ordinances of the Lord He said, \"Thou shalt teach them\ndiligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest\nin thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou\nliest \u00a0down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign\nupon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And\nthou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy\ngates.\" \u00a0Deuteronomy 6:7-9. In His own teaching, Jesus showed how this\ncommand is to be fulfilled---how the laws and principles of God's\nkingdom can be so presented as to reveal their beauty and preciousness.\nWhen the Lord was training Israel to be the special representatives of\nHimself, He gave them homes among the hills and valleys. In their home\nlife and their religious service they were brought in constant contact\nwith nature and with the word of God. So Christ taught His disciples by\nthe lake, on the mountainside, in the fields and groves, where they\ncould look upon the things of nature by which He illustrated His\nteachings. And as they learned of Christ, they put their knowledge to\nuse by co-operating with Him in His work. \u00a0{COL 23.2}",
                "So through the creation we are to become acquainted with the Creator.\nThe book of nature is a great lesson book, which in connection with the\nScriptures we are to use in teaching others of His character, and\nguiding lost sheep back to the fold of God. As the works of God are\nstudied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction into the mind. It is not the\nconviction that logical reasoning produces; but unless the mind has\nbecome too dark to know God, the eye too dim to see Him, the ear too\ndull to hear His voice, a deeper meaning is grasped, and the sublime,\nspiritual truths of the written word are impressed on the heart. \u00a0{COL\n24.1}",
                "In these lessons direct from nature, there is a simplicity and purity\nthat makes them of the highest value. All need the teaching to be\nderived from this source. In itself the beauty of nature leads the soul\naway from sin and worldly attractions, and toward purity, peace, and\nGod. \u00a0Too often the minds of students are occupied with men's theories\nand speculations, falsely called science and philosophy. They need to be\nbrought into close contact with nature. Let them learn that creation and\nChristianity have one God. Let them be taught to see the harmony of the\nnatural with the spiritual. Let everything which their eyes see or their\nhands handle be made a lesson in character building. Thus the mental\npowers will be strengthened, the character developed, the whole life\nennobled. \u00a0{COL 24.2}",
                "Christ's purpose in parable teaching was in direct line with the purpose\nof the Sabbath. God gave to men the memorial of His creative power, that\nthey might discern Him in the works of His hand. The Sabbath bids us\nbehold in His created works the glory of the Creator. And \u00a0it was because\nHe desired us to do this that Jesus bound up His precious lessons with\nthe beauty of natural things. On the holy rest day, above all other\ndays, we should study the messages that God has written for us in\nnature. We should study the Saviour's parables where He spoke them, in\nthe fields and groves, under the open sky, among the grass and flowers.\nAs we come close to the heart of nature, Christ makes His presence real\nto us, and speaks to our hearts of His peace and love. \u00a0{COL 25.1}",

In the plowing and sowing, the tilling and reaping, He\nteaches us to see an illustration of His work of grace in the heart. So\nin every line of useful labor and every association of life, He desires\nus to find a lesson of divine truth. Then our daily toil will no longer\nabsorb our attention and lead \u00a0us to forget God; it will continually\nremind us of our Creator and Redeemer. The thought of God will run like\na thread of gold through all our homely cares and occupations. For us\nthe glory of His face will again rest upon the face of nature.

And His parable teaching itself was the seed with which the most\nprecious truths of His grace were sown. Because of its simplicity the\nparable of the sower has not been valued as it should be. From the\nnatural seed cast into the soil, Christ desires to lead our minds to the\ngospel seed, the sowing of which results in bringing man back to his\nloyalty to God. He who gave the parable of the tiny seed is the\nSovereign of heaven, and the same laws that govern earthly seed sowing\ngovern the sowing of the seeds of truth. \u00a0{COL 33.1}",

                "Christ's mission was not understood by the people of His time. The\nmanner of His coming was not in accordance with their expectations. The\nLord Jesus was the foundation of the whole Jewish economy. Its imposing\nservices were of divine appointment. They were designed to teach the\npeople that at the time appointed One would come to whom those\nceremonies pointed. But the Jews had exalted the forms and ceremonies\nand had lost sight of their object. The traditions, maxims, and\nenactments of men hid from them the lessons which God intended\nto \u00a0convey. These maxims and traditions became an obstacle to their\nunderstanding and practice of true religion. And when the Reality came,\nin the person of Christ, they did not recognize in Him the fulfillment\nof all their types, the substance of all their shadows. They rejected\nthe antitype, and clung to their types and useless ceremonies. The Son\nof God had come, but they continued to ask for a sign. The message,\n\"Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,\" they answered by\ndemands for a miracle. \u00a0Matthew 3:2. The gospel of Christ was a stumbling\nblock to them because they demanded signs instead of a Saviour. They\nexpected the Messiah to prove His claims by mighty deeds of conquest, to\nestablish His empire on the ruins of earthly kingdoms. This expectation\nChrist answered in the parable of the sower. Not by force of arms, not\nby violent interpositions, was the kingdom of God to prevail, but by the\nimplanting of a new principle in the hearts of men. \u00a0{COL 34.4}",
                "\"He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.\" \u00a0Matthew 13:37.

So Christ, the heavenly Sower,\nwent forth to sow. He left His home of security and peace, left the\nglory that He had with the Father before the world was, left His\nposition upon the throne of the universe.

The exciting\nsports---theatergoing, horse racing, gambling, liquor-drinking, and\nreveling---stimulate every passion to intense activity. The youth are\nswept away by the popular current. Those who learn to love amusement for\nits own \u00a0sake open the door to a flood of temptations. They give\nthemselves up to social gaiety and thoughtless mirth, and their\nintercourse with pleasure lovers has an intoxicating effect upon the\nmind.

He accepted\ninvitations from the rich as well as the poor, and according to His\ncustom He linked the scene before Him with His lessons of truth. Among\nthe Jews the sacred feast was connected with all their seasons of\nnational and religious rejoicing. It was to them a type of the blessings\nof eternal life. The great feast at which they were to sit down with\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob, while the Gentiles stood without, and looked\non with longing eyes, was a theme on which they delighted to dwell. The\nlesson of warning and instruction which Christ desired to give, He now\nillustrated by the parable of a great supper. The blessings of God, both\nfor the present and for the future life, the Jews thought to shut up to\nthemselves. They denied God's mercy to the Gentiles. By the parable\nChrist showed that they were themselves at that very time rejecting the\ninvitation of mercy, the call to God's kingdom. \u00a0He showed that the\ninvitation which they had slighted was to be sent to those whom they\ndespised, those from whom they had drawn away their garments as if they\nwere lepers to be shunned. \u00a0{COL 219.1}",
                "In choosing the guests for his feast, the Pharisee had consulted his own\nselfish interest.

But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the\nlame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense\nthee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the\njust.\" \u00a0{COL 220.1}",

These\ngatherings were to be as object lessons to Israel. Being thus taught the\njoy of true hospitality, the people were throughout the year to care for\nthe bereaved and the poor.

His attitude was similar to the attitude of\nthose who rejoice that they are saved by Christ, when they do not comply\nwith the conditions upon which salvation is promised. His spirit was\nlike that of Balaam when he prayed, \"Let me die the death of the\nrighteous, and let my last end be like his.\" \u00a0Numbers 23:10.

But the Saviour entered into no\ncontroversy. He required the answer from the questioner himself. \"What\nis written in the law?\" He asked, \"How readest thou?\" The Jews still\naccused Jesus of lightly regarding the law given from Sinai, but He\nturned the question of salvation upon the keeping of God's\ncommandments. \u00a0{COL 377.1}",

He had a vital interest in the matter, and he asked\nin sincerity, \"What shall I do?\" In his answer as to the requirements of\nthe law, he passed by all the mass of ceremonial and ritualistic\nprecepts. For these he claimed no value, but presented the two great\nprinciples on which hang all the law and the prophets.

The requirement under the covenant\nof grace is just as broad as the requirement made in Eden---harmony with\nGod's law, which is holy, just, and good. \u00a0{COL 391.2}",

                "The young man answered without hesitation, \"All these things have I kept\nfrom my youth up; what lack I yet?\" His conception of the law was\nexternal and superficial. Judged by a human standard, he had preserved\nan unblemished character. To a great degree his outward life had been\nfree from guilt; he verily thought that his obedience had been without a\nflaw.

He professed to\nhave kept the commandments, but he was destitute of the principle which\nis the very spirit and life of them all. He did not possess true love\nfor God or man.

The same consecration was required of the young ruler.\nAnd in this Christ did not ask a greater sacrifice than He Himself had\nmade. \"He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through\nHis poverty might be rich.\" \u00a02 Corinthians 8:9. The young man had only to\nfollow where Christ led the way. \u00a0{COL 393.1}",

This privilege had\nbeen counted a joy by Peter, James, and John. The young man himself\nlooked upon Christ with admiration. His heart was drawn toward the\nSaviour. But he was not ready to accept the Saviour's principle of\nself-sacrifice. He chose his riches before Jesus. He wanted eternal\nlife, but would not receive into the soul that unselfish love which\nalone is life, and with a sorrowful heart he turned away from\nChrist. \u00a0{COL 393.2}",

                "Lest the disciples should lose sight of the principles of the gospel,\nChrist related to them a parable illustrating the manner in which God\ndeals with His servants, and the spirit in which He desires them to\nlabor for Him. \u00a0{COL 396.2}",

By the lamps is represented the word of God. The psalmist\nsays, \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\" \u00a0Psalm\n119:105. The oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Thus the Spirit is\nrepresented in the prophecy of Zechariah. \"The angel that talked with me\ncame again,\" he says, \"and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his\nsleep, and said unto me, What seest thou?

They receive the\nword with readiness, but they fail of assimilating its principles. Its\ninfluence is not abiding. The Spirit works upon man's heart, according\nto his desire and consent implanting in him a new nature; but the class\nrepresented by the foolish virgins have been content with a superficial\nwork. They do not know God. They have not studied His character; they\nhave not held communion with Him; therefore they do not know how to\ntrust, how to look and live. Their service to God degenerates into a\nform. \"They come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before\nthee as My people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them;\nfor with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after\ntheir covetousness.\" \u00a0Ezekiel 33:31.

The grace of God has been freely offered\nto every soul. The message of the gospel has been heralded, \"Let him\nthat is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life\nfreely.\" \u00a0Revelation 22:17. But character is not transferable. No man can\nbelieve for another. No man can receive the Spirit for another. No man\ncan impart to another the character which is the fruit of the Spirit's\nworking. \"Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it \\[the land\\], as I\nlive, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter;\nthey shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.\" \u00a0Ezekiel\n14:20. \u00a0{COL 411.2}",

Both parties were taken\nunawares; but one was prepared for the emergency, and the other was\nfound without preparation. So now, a sudden and unlooked-for calamity,\nsomething that brings the soul face to face with death, will show\nwhether there is any real faith in the promises of God. It will show\nwhether the soul is sustained by grace. The great final test comes at\nthe close of human probation, when it will be too late for the soul's\nneed to be supplied. \u00a0{COL 412.1}",
