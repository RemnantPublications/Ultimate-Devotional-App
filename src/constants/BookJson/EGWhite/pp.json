The great controversy between truth\nand error, between light and darkness, between the power of God and the\nattempted usurpations of the enemy of all righteousness, is the one\ngreat spectacle which it is reasonable to suppose must engage the\nattention of all worlds. That such a controversy exists as the result of\nsin, that it is to pass through various stages of progress, and end at\nlast in a manner to redound to the glory of God and the higher\nexaltation of His loyal servants, is as certain as that the Bible is a\nrevelation from God to men.

Thus the scenes have a\nvividness and importance that tend to make new and lasting impressions.\nSuch a light is shed upon the Scripture record as to reveal more fully\nthe character and purposes of God; to make manifest the wiles of Satan\nand the means by which his power will be finally overthrown; to bring to\nview the weakness of the human heart, and show how the grace of God has\nenabled men to conquer in the battle with evil. All this is in harmony\nwith what God has shown to be His purpose in unfolding to men the truths\nof His word. The agency by which these revelations have been given is\nseen---when tested by the Scriptures---to be one of the methods God\nstill employs to impart instruction to the children of men. \u00a0{PP 19.1}",

So we hear the apostle Paul declaring\nthat a certain divine \"illumination\" is the privilege of the followers\nof Christ; and that they are \"enlightened\" by being made \"partakers of\nthe Holy Ghost.\" \u00a0Hebrews 10:32; \u00a06:4. John also says, \"Ye have an unction\nfrom the Holy One.\" \u00a01 John 2:20. And Christ promised the disciples, as\nHe was about to leave them, that He would send them the Holy Spirit as a\ncomforter and guide to lead them into all truth. \u00a0John 14:16, 26. \u00a0{PP\n19.2}",
                "To show how this promise was to be fulfilled to the church, the apostle\nPaul, in two of his epistles, presents formal declaration that certain\ngifts of the Spirit have been placed in the Church for its edification\nand instruction to the end of time. \u00a01 Corinthians 12; \u00a0Ephesians\n4:8-13; \u00a0Matthew 28:20 \u00a0Nor is this all: a number of clear and explicit\nprophecies declare that in the last days there will be a special\noutpouring of the Holy Spirit, and that the church at the time of\nChrist's appearing will have had, during its closing experience, \"the\ntestimony of Jesus,\" which is the spirit of prophecy. \u00a0Acts 2:17-20,\n39; \u00a01 Corinthians 1:7; \u00a0Revelation 12:17; \u00a0Revelation 19:10. In these\nfacts we see an evidence of God's care and love for His people; for the\npresence of the Holy Spirit as a comforter, teacher, and guide, not only\nin its ordinary, but in its extraordinary, methods of operation,\ncertainly is needed by the church as it enters the perils of the last\ndays, more than in any other part of its experience. \u00a0{PP 20.1}",
                "The Scriptures point out various channels through which the Holy Spirit\nwould operate on the hearts and minds of men to enlighten their\nunderstanding and guide their steps. Among these were visions and\ndreams. In this way God would still communicate with the children of\nmen. Here is His promise on this point: \"Hear now my words: If there be\na prophet among you, I the Lord will make Myself known unto him in a\nvision, and will speak unto him in a dream.\" \u00a0Numbers 12:6. By this means\nsupernatural knowledge was communicated to Balaam. Thus He says: \"Balaam\nthe son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: he\nhath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the\nMost High, which saw the vision of the almighty, falling into a trance,\nbut having his eyes open.\" \u00a0Numbers 24:15, 16. \u00a0{PP 20.2}",
                "It thus becomes a matter of great interest to investigate the testimony\nof the Scriptures concerning the extent to which the Lord designed that\nthe Spirit should manifest itself in the church during the period of\nhuman probation. \u00a0{PP 20.3}",
                "After the plan of salvation had been devised, God, as we have seen,\ncould still, through the ministry of His Son and the holy angels,\ncommunicate with men across the gulf which sin had made. Sometimes He\nspoke face to face with them, as in the case of Moses, but more\nfrequently by dreams and visions. Instances of such communication are\neverywhere prominent upon the sacred record, covering all dispensations.\nEnoch the seventh from Adam looked forward in the spirit of prophecy to\nthe second advent of Christ in power and glory, and exclaimed, \"Behold,\nthe Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints.\" \u00a0Jude 14. \"Holy men of\nGod spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\" \u00a02 Peter 1:21. If the\noperation of the spirit of prophecy has at times seemed almost to\ndisappear, as the spirituality of the people waned, it has nevertheless\nmarked all the great crises in the experience of the church, and the\nepochs which witnessed the change from one dispensation to another. When\nthe era marked by the incarnation of Christ was reached, the father of\nJohn the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied. \u00a0Luke\n1:67. To Simeon it was revealed that he should not see death till he had\nseen the Lord; and when the parents of Jesus brought Him into the temple\nthat He might be dedicated, Simeon came by the Spirit into the temple,\ntook Him into his arms, and blessed Him while he prophesied concerning\nHim. And Anna, a prophetess, coming in the same instant, spake of Him to\nall them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. \u00a0Luke 2:26, 36. \u00a0{PP\n21.1}",
                "The outpouring of the Holy Spirit which was to attend the preaching of\nthe gospel by the followers of Christ was announced by the prophet in\nthese words: \"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out\nMy Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall\nprophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see\nvisions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days\nwill I pour out My Spirit. And I will show wonders in the heavens and in\nthe earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be\nturned \u00a0into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the\nterrible day of the Lord come.\" \u00a0Joel 2:28-31. \u00a0{PP 21.2}",
                "Peter, on the Day of Pentecost, quoted this prophecy in explanation of\nthe wonderful scene which then occurred. Cloven tongues like as of fire\nsat upon each of the disciples; they were filled with the holy spirit,\nand spake with other tongues. And when the mockers charged that they\nwere filled with new wine, Peter answered, \"These are not drunken, as ye\nsuppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. But this is that\nwhich was spoken by the prophet Joel.\" Then he quotes the prophecy\nsubstantially as found in Joel (quoted above), only he puts the words\n\"in the last days,\" in the place of \"Afterward,\" making it read, \"and it\nshall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My\nSpirit,\" etc. \u00a0{PP 22.1}",
                "It is evident that it was that part of the prophecy only which relates\nto the outpouring of the Spirit, that began to be fulfilled on that day;\nfor there were no old men there dreaming dreams, nor young men and\nmaidens seeing visions and prophesying; and no wonders of blood and fire\nand pillars of smoke then appeared; and the sun was not darkened and the\nmoon was not turned to blood at that time; and yet what was there\nwitnessed was in fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel. It is equally\nevident that this part of the prophecy concerning the outpouring of the\nSpirit was not exhausted in that one manifestation; for the prophecy\ncovers all days from that time on to the coming of the great day of the\nLord. \u00a0{PP 22.2}"

                "On the Day of Pentecost the disciples were thus endued with power from\non high. But this promise of Christ's was not, any more than the\nprophecy of Joel, confined to that occasion. For He gave them the same\npromise in another form by assuring them that He would be with them\nalways, even to the end of the world. \u00a0Matthew 28:20. Mark tells us in\nwhat sense and what manner the Lord was to be with them. He says, \"And\nthey went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them,\nand confirming the word with signs following.\" \u00a0Mark 16:20. And Peter, on\nthe Day of Pentecost, testified concerning the perpetuity of this\noperation of the Spirit which they had witnessed. When the convicted\nJews said unto the apostles, \"What shall we do?\" Peter answered,\n\"Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ\nfor the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy\nGhost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all\nthat are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.\" \u00a0Acts\n2:37-39. This certainly provides for the operation of the Holy Spirit in\nthe church, even in its special manifestations, to all coming time, as\nlong as mercy shall invite men to accept the pardoning love of\nChrist. \u00a0{PP 23.1}",
                "Twenty-eight years later in his letter to the Corinthians, Paul set\nbefore that church a formal argument on the question. He says (1\nCorinthians 12:1), \"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would\nnot have you ignorant\"---so important did he deem it that this subject\nshould be understood in the Christian church. After stating that though\nthe Spirit is one it has diversities of operation, and explaining what\nthose diversities are, he introduces the figure of the human body, with\nits various members, to show how the church is constituted with its\ndifferent offices and gifts. And as the body has its various members,\neach having itsparticular office to fill, and all working together in\nunity of purpose to constitute one harmonious whole, so the Spirit was\nto operate through various channels in the church to constitute a\nperfect religious body. Paul then continues in these words: \"And God\nhath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets,\nthirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps,\ngovernments, diversities of tongues.\" \u00a0{PP 23.2}",
                "The declaration that God \u00a0*hath set* \u00a0some in the church, etc., implies\nsomething more than that the way was left open for the gifts to appear\nif circumstances should chance to favor. It rather signifies that they\nwere to be permanent parts of the true spiritual constitution of the\nchurch, and that if these were not in active operation the church would\nbe in the condition of a human body, some of whose members had, through\naccident or disease, become crippled and helpless. Having once been set\nin the church, there these gifts must remain until they are formally\nremoved. But there is no record that they ever have been removed. \u00a0{PP\n24.1}",
                "Five years later the same apostle writes to the Ephesians relative to\nthe same gifts, plainly stating their object, and thus showing\nindirectly that they must continue till that object is accomplished. He\nsays (Ephesians 4:8, 11-13): \"Wherefore He saith, when He ascended up on\nhigh, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men\\.... And He gave\nsome, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some,\npastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of\nthe ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come\nin the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto\na perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of\nChrist.\" \u00a0{PP 24.2}",
                "The church did not reach the state of unity here contemplated, in the\napostolic age; and very soon after that age, the gloom of the great\nspiritual apostasy began to overshadow the church; and certainly during\nthe state of declension, this fullness of Christ, and unity of faith,\nwas not reached. Nor will it be reached tillthe last message of mercy\nshall have gathered out of every kindred and people, every class of\nsociety, and every organization of error, a people complete in all\ngospel reforms, waiting for the coming of the Son of man. And truly, if\never in her experience the church would need the benefit of every agency\nordained for her comfort and guidance, encouragement and protection, it\nwould be amid the perils of the last days, when the powers of evil,\nwell-nigh perfected by experience and training for their nefarious work,\nwould, by their masterpieces of imposture, deceive if it were possible\neven the elect. Very appropriately, therefore, come in the special\nprophecies of the outpouring of the Spirit for the benefit of the church\nin the last days. \u00a0{PP 24.3}",
                "It is, however, usually taught, in the current literature of the\nChristian world, that the gifts of the Spirit were only for the\napostolic age; that they were given simply for the planting of the\ngospel; and that the gospel being once established, the gifts were no\nlonger needed, and consequently were suffered soon to disappear from the\nchurch. But the apostle Paul warned the Christians of his day that the\n\"mystery of iniquity\" was already at work, and that after his departure,\ngrievous wolves would enter in among them, not sparing the flock, and\nthat also of their own selves men would arise, speaking perverse things\nto draw away disciples after them. \u00a0Acts 20:29, 30. It cannot therefore\nbe that the gifts, placed in the church to guard against these very\nevils, were ready, when that time came, to pass away as having\naccomplished their object; for their presence and help would be needed\nunder these conditions more than when the apostles themselves were on\nthe stage of action. \u00a0{PP 25.1}",
                "We find another statement in Paul's letter to the Corinthian church,\nwhich shows that the popular conception of the temporary continuance of\nthe gifts cannot be correct. It is his contrast between the present,\nimperfect state, and the glorious, immortal condition to which the\nChristian will finally arrive. \u00a01 Corinthians 13. He says (Verses 9, 10).\n\"For we know in part, and we \u00a0prophesy in part. But when that which is\nperfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\" He\nfurther illustrates this present state by comparing it to the period of\nchildhood with its weakness and immaturity of thought and action; and\nthe perfect state, to the condition of manhood with its clearer vision,\nmaturity, and strength. And he classes the gifts among those things\nwhich are needed in this present, imperfect condition, but which we\nshall have no occasion for when the perfect state is come. \"Now,\" he\nsays (Verse 12), \"we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:\nNow I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\" Then\nhe states what graces are adapted to the eternal state, and will there\nexist, namely, faith, hope, and charity, or love, \"these three; but the\ngreatest of these is charity.\" \u00a0{PP 25.2}",
                "This explains the language of \u00a0Verse 8: \"Charity never faileth;\" that is,\ncharity, the heavenly grace of love, will endure forever; it is the\ncrowning glory of man's future, immortal condition; but \"whether there\nbe prophecies, they shall fail;\" that is, the time will come when\nprophecies will be no longer needed, and the gift of prophecy, as one of\nthe helps in the church, will no longer be exercised; \"whether there be\ntongues, they shall cease;\" that is, the gift of tongues will no longer\nbe of service; \"whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away;\" that\nis, knowledge, not in the abstract, but as one of the special gifts of\nthe Spirit, will be rendered unnecessary by the perfect knowledge with\nwhich we shall be endowed in the eternal world. \u00a0{PP 26.1}",
                "Now, if we take the position that the gifts ceased with the apostolic\nage, because no longer needed, we commit ourselves to the position that\nthe apostolic age was the weak and childish age of the church, when\neverything was seen through a glass, darkly; but the age that followed,\nwhen grievous wolves were to enter in, not sparing the flock, and men\nwere to arise, even in the church, speaking perverse things to draw away\ndisciples after them, was an age of perfect light and knowledge, in\nwhich the imperfect and \u00a0childish and darkened knowledge of apostolic\ntimes had passed away! For, be it remembered, the gifts cease only when\na perfect state is reached, and because that state is reached, which\nrenders them no longer necessary. But no one, on sober thought, can for\na moment seek to maintain the position that the apostolic age was\ninferior in spiritual elevation to any age which has succeeded it.

The text further declares that\nthese \"keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus\nChrist;\" and the \"testimony of Jesus\" is explained in \u00a0chapter 19:10 \u00a0to\nbe \"the spirit of prophecy,\" which must be understood as that which\namong the gifts is called \"the gift of prophecy.\" \u00a01 Corinthians 12:9,\n10. \u00a0{PP 27.2}",

Are all prophets? Are all\nteachers?\" etc. the implied answer is no; not all are; but the gifts are\ndivided among the members as it pleases \u00a0God. \u00a01 Corinthians 12:7, 11. Yet\nthese gifts are said to be \"set in the \u00a0*church*,\" and if a gift is\nbestowed upon even one member of the church, it may be said that that\ngift is \"in the church,\" or that the church \"has\" it.

The time had come for a final decision; he\nmust fully yield to the divine sovereignty or place himself in open\nrebellion. He nearly reached the decision to return, but pride forbade\nhim.

When\nChrist came to our world in the form of humanity, all were intensely\ninterested in following Him as He traversed, step by step, the\nbloodstained path from the manger to Calvary. Heaven marked the insult\nand mockery that He received, and knew that it was at Satan's\ninstigation. They marked the work of counteragencies going forward;\nSatan constantly pressing darkness, sorrow, and suffering upon the race,\nand Christ counteracting it. They watched the battle between light and\ndarkness as it waxed stronger. And as Christ \u00a0in His expiring agony upon\nthe cross cried out, \"It is finished\" (John 19:30), a shout of triumph\nrang through every world and through heaven itself. The great contest\nthat had been so long in progress in this world was now decided, and\nChrist was conqueror. His death had answered the question whether the\nFather and the Son had sufficient love for man to exercise self-denial\nand a spirit of sacrifice. Satan had revealed his true character as a\nliar and a murderer. It was seen that the very same spirit with which he\nhad ruled the children of men who were under his power, he would have\nmanifested if permitted to control the intelligences of heaven. With one\nvoice the loyal universe united in extolling the divine\nadministration. \u00a0{PP 69.3}",

It is demonstrated that the\nwages of sin is death. When Christ died, the destruction of Satan was\nmade certain. But if the law was abolished at the cross, as many claim,\nthen the agony and death of God's dear Son were endured only to give to\nSatan just what he asked; then the prince of evil triumphed, his charges\nagainst the divine government were sustained. The very fact that Christ\nbore the penalty of man's transgression is a mighty argument to all\ncreated intelligences that the law is changeless; that God is righteous,\nmerciful, and self-denying; and that infinite justice and mercy unite in\nthe administration of His government. \u00a0{PP 70.1}"

                "Like the Sabbath, the week originated at creation, and it has been\npreserved and brought down to us through Bible history. God Himself\nmeasured off the first week as a sample for successive weeks to the\nclose of time. Like every other, it consisted of seven literal days. Six\ndays were employed in the work of creation; upon the seventh, God\nrested, and He then blessed this day and set it apart as a day of rest\nfor man. \u00a0{PP 111.1}",
                "In the law given from Sinai, God recognized the week, and the facts upon\nwhich it is based. After giving the command, \"Remember the Sabbath day,\nto keep it holy,\" and specifying what shall be done on the six days, and\nwhat shall not be done on the seventh, He states the reason for thus\nobserving the week, by pointing back to His own example: \"For in six\ndays the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,\nand rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day,\nand hallowed it.\" \u00a0Exodus 20:8-11. This reason appears beautiful and\nforcible when we understand the days of creation to be literal. The\nfirst six days of each week are given to man for labor, because God\nemployed the same period of the first week in the work of creation. On\nthe seventh day man is to refrain from labor, in commemoration of the\nCreator's rest. \u00a0{PP 111.2}",
                "But the assumption that the events of the first week required thousands\nupon thousands of years, strikes directly at the foundation of the\nfourth commandment. It represents the Creator as commanding men to\nobserve the week of literal days in commemoration of vast, indefinite\nperiods. This is unlike His method of dealing with His creatures. It\nmakes indefinite and obscure that which He has made very plain. It is\ninfidelity in its most insidious and hence most dangerous form; its real\ncharacter is so disguised that it is held and taught by many who profess\nto believe the Bible. \u00a0{PP 111.3}",

The Bible recognizes no\nlong ages in which the earth was slowly evolved from chaos. Of each\nsuccessive day of creation, the sacred record declares that it consisted\nof the evening and the morning, like all other days that have followed.\nAt the close of each day is given the result of the Creator's work. The\nstatement is made at the close of the first week's record, \"These are\nthe generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were\ncreated.\" \u00a0Genesis 2:4.

In the history of the Flood, inspiration has explained\nthat which geology alone could never fathom. In the days of Noah, men,\nanimals, and trees, many times larger than now exist, were buried, and\nthus preserved as an evidence to later generations that the\nantediluvians perished by a flood. God designed that the discovery of\nthese things should establish faith in inspired history; but men, with\ntheir vain reasoning, fall into the same error as did the people before\nthe Flood---the things which God gave them as a benefit, they turn into\na curse by making a wrong use of them. \u00a0{PP 112.3}",

To cast one lingering\nlook upon the devoted city, to tarry for one moment from regret to leave\nso beautiful a home, would have \u00a0cost their life. The storm of divine\njudgment was only waiting that these poor fugitives might make their\nescape. \u00a0{PP 160.2}",
                "But Lot, confused and terrified, pleaded that he could not do as he was\nrequired lest some evil should overtake him and he should die. Living in\nthat wicked city, in the midst of unbelief, his faith had grown dim. The\nPrince of heaven was by his side, yet he pleaded for his own life as\nthough God, who had manifested such care and love for him, would not\nstill preserve him. He should have trusted himself wholly to the divine\nMessenger, giving his will and his life into the Lord's hands without a\ndoubt or a question. But like so many others, he endeavored to plan for\nhimself: \"Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little\none: O, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul\nshall live.\" The city here mentioned was Bela, afterward called Zoar. It\nwas but a few miles from Sodom, and, like it, was corrupt and doomed to\ndestruction. But Lot asked that it might be spared, urging that this was\nbut a small request; and his desire was granted. The Lord assured him,\n\"I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not\noverthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.\" Oh, how great the\nmercy of God toward His erring creatures! \u00a0{PP 161.1}",

If Lot himself had manifested no hesitancy to obey the angels'\nwarning, but had earnestly fled toward the mountains, without one word\nof pleading or remonstrance, his wife also would have made her escape.\nThe influence of his example would have saved her from the sin that\nsealed her doom. But his hesitancy and delay caused her to lightly\nregard the divine warning. While her body was upon the plain, her heart\nclung to Sodom, and she perished with it. She rebelled against God\nbecause His judgments involved her possessions and her children in the\nruin. Although so greatly favored in being called out from the wicked\ncity, she felt that she was severely dealt with, because the wealth that\nit had taken years to accumulate must be left to destruction. Instead of\nthankfully accepting deliverance, she presumptuously looked back to\ndesire the life of those who had rejected the divine warning. Her sin\nshowed her \u00a0to be unworthy of life, for the preservation of which she\nfelt so little gratitude. \u00a0{PP 161.2}",

Have they forgotten that they are bound by the strongest\nties of love and honor and loyalty to the service of their Creator and\nRedeemer? The invitations of mercy are addressed to all; and because our\nfriends reject the Saviour's pleading love, shall we also turn away? The\nredemption of the soul is precious. Christ has paid an infinite price\nfor our salvation, and no one who appreciates the value of this great\nsacrifice or the worth of the soul will despise God's offered mercy\nbecause others choose to do so.

The quiet, peace-loving shepherd was attracted by the daring\nand vigor of this elder son, who fearlessly ranged over mountain and\ndesert, returning home with game for his father and with exciting\naccounts of his adventurous life. Jacob, thoughtful, diligent, and\ncare-taking, ever thinking more of the future than the present, was\ncontent to dwell at home, occupied in the care of the flocks and the\ntillage of the soil. His patient perseverance, thrift, and foresight\nwere valued by the mother.

The Christian should often review his past life and recall\nwith gratitude the precious deliverances that God has wrought for him,\nsupporting him in trial, opening ways before him when all seemed dark\nand forbidding, refreshing him when ready to faint. He should recognize\nall of them as evidences of the watchcare of heavenly angels. In view of\nthese innumerable blessings he should often ask, with subdued and\ngrateful heart, \"What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits\ntoward me?\" \u00a0Psalm 116:12. \u00a0{PP 187.3}",
                "Our time, our talents, our property, should be sacredly devoted to Him\nwho has given us these blessings in trust. Whenever a special\ndeliverance is wrought in our behalf, or new and \u00a0unexpected favors are\ngranted us, we should acknowledge God's goodness, not only by expressing\nour gratitude in words, but, like Jacob, by gifts and offerings to His\ncause. As we are continually receiving the blessings of God, so we are\nto be continually giving. \u00a0{PP 187.4}",
                "\"Of all that Thou shalt give me,\" said Jacob, \"I will surely give the\ntenth unto Thee.\" Shall we who enjoy the full light and privileges of\nthe gospel be content to give less to God than was given by those who\nlived in the former, less favored dispensation? Nay, as the blessings we\nenjoy are greater, are not our obligations correspondingly increased?\nBut how small the estimate; how vain the endeavor to measure with\nmathematical rules, time, money, and love, against a love so\nimmeasurable and a gift of such inconceivable worth. Tithes for Christ!\nOh, meager pittance, shameful recompense for that which cost so much!\nFrom the cross of Calvary, Christ calls for an unreserved consecration.\nAll that we have, all that we are, should be devoted to God. \u00a0{PP 188.1}",

But how\ndifferent his arrival from that of Abraham's messenger nearly a hundred\nyears before! The servant had come with a train of attendants riding\nupon camels, and with rich gifts of gold and silver; the son was a\nlonely, footsore traveler, with no possession save his staff. Like\nAbraham's servant, Jacob tarried beside a well, and it was here that he\nmet Rachel, Laban's younger daughter. It was Jacob now who rendered\nservice, rolling the stone from the well and watering the flocks. On\nmaking known his kinship, he was welcomed to the home of Laban. Though\nhe came portionless and unattended, a few weeks showed the worth of his\ndiligence and skill, and he was urged to tarry.

                "In early times custom required the bridegroom, before the ratification\nof a marriage engagement, to pay a sum of money or its equivalent in\nother property, according to his circumstances, to the father of his\nwife. This was regarded as a safeguard to the marriage relation. Fathers\ndid not think it safe to trust the happiness of their daughters to men\nwho had not made provision for the support of a family. If they had not\nsufficient thrift and energy to manage business and acquire cattle or\nlands, it was feared that \u00a0their life would prove worthless. But\nprovision was made to test those who had nothing to pay for a wife. They\nwere permitted to labor for the father whose daughter they loved, the\nlength of time being regulated by the value of the dowry required. When\nthe suitor was faithful in his services, and proved in other respects\nworthy, he obtained the daughter as his wife; and generally the dowry\nwhich the father had received was given her at her marriage. In the case\nof both Rachel and Leah, however, Laban selfishly retained the dowry\nthat should have been given them; they referred to this when they said,\njust before the removal from Mesopotamia, \"He hath sold us, and hath\nquite devoured also our money.\" \u00a0{PP 188.3}",

In our time many evils result from pursuing an\nopposite course. It is often the case that persons before marriage have\nlittle opportunity to become acquainted with each other's habits and\ndisposition, and, so far as everyday life is concerned, they are\nvirtually strangers when they unite their interests at the altar. Many\nfind, too late, that they are not adapted to each other, and lifelong\nwretchedness is the result of their union. Often the wife and children\nsuffer from the indolence and inefficiency or the vicious habits of the\nhusband and father.

Alas! for that day is\ngreat, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble;\nbut he shall be saved out of it.\" \u00a0Jeremiah 30:5-7. \u00a0{PP 201.1}",
                "When Christ shall cease His work as mediator in man's behalf, then this\ntime of trouble will begin. Then the case of every soul will have been\ndecided, and there will be no atoning blood to cleanse from sin. When\nJesus leaves His position as man's intercessor before God, the solemn\nannouncement is made, \"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and\nhe which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous,\nlet him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy\nstill.\" \u00a0Revelation 22:11. Then the restraining Spirit of God is\nwithdrawn from the earth. As Jacob was threatened with death by his\nangry brother, so the people of God will be in peril from the wicked who\nare seeking to destroy them. And as the patriarch wrestled all night for\ndeliverance from the hand of Esau, so the righteous will cry to God day\nand night for deliverance from the enemies that surround them. \u00a0{PP\n201.2}",
                "Satan had accused Jacob before the angels of God, claiming the right to\ndestroy him because of his sin; he had moved upon Esau to march against\nhim; and during the patriarch's long night of wrestling, Satan\nendeavored to force upon him a sense of his guilt, in order to\ndiscourage him, and break his hold upon God. When in his distress Jacob\nlaid hold of the Angel, and made supplication with tears, the heavenly\nMessenger, in order to try his faith, also reminded him of his sin, and\nendeavored to escape from him. But Jacob would not be turned away. He\nhad learned that God is merciful, and he cast himself upon His mercy. He\npointed \u00a0back to his repentance for his sin, and pleaded for deliverance.\nAs he reviewed his life, he was driven almost to despair; but he held\nfast the Angel, and with earnest, agonizing cries urged his petition\nuntil he prevailed. \u00a0{PP 201.3}",
                "Such will be the experience of God's people in their final struggle with\nthe powers of evil. God will test their faith, their perseverance, their\nconfidence in His power to deliver them. Satan will endeavor to terrify\nthem with the thought that their cases are hopeless; that their sins\nhave been too great to receive pardon. They will have a deep sense of\ntheir shortcomings, and as they review their lives their hopes will\nsink. But remembering the greatness of God's mercy, and their own\nsincere repentance, they will plead His promises made through Christ to\nhelpless, repenting sinners. Their faith will not fail because their\nprayers are not immediately answered. They will lay hold of the strength\nof God, as Jacob laid hold of the Angel, and the language of their souls\nwill be, \"I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\" \u00a0{PP 202.1}",
                "Had not Jacob previously repented of his sin in obtaining the birthright\nby fraud, God could not have heard his prayer and mercifully preserved\nhis life. So in the time of trouble, if the people of God had\nunconfessed sins to appear before them while tortured with fear and\nanguish, they would be overwhelmed; despair would cut off their faith,\nand they could not have confidence to plead with God for deliverance.\nBut while they have a deep sense of their unworthiness, they will have\nno concealed wrongs to reveal. Their sins will have been blotted out by\nthe atoning blood of Christ, and they cannot bring them to\nremembrance. \u00a0{PP 202.2}",

All who endeavor\nto excuse or conceal their sins, and permit them to remain upon the\nbooks of heaven, unconfessed and unforgiven, will be overcome by Satan.\nThe more exalted their profession, and the more honorable the position\nwhich they hold, the more grievous is their course in the sight of God,\nand the more certain the triumph of the great adversary. \u00a0{PP 202.3}",
                "Yet Jacob's history is an assurance that God will not cast off those who\nhave been betrayed into sin, but who have returned \u00a0unto Him with true\nrepentance. It was by self-surrender and confiding faith that Jacob\ngained what he had failed to gain by conflict in his own strength. God\nthus taught His servant that divine power and grace alone could give him\nthe blessing he craved. Thus it will be with those who live in the last\ndays. As dangers surround them, and despair seizes upon the soul, they\nmust depend solely upon the merits of the atonement. We can do nothing\nof ourselves. In all our helpless unworthiness we must trust in the\nmerits of the crucified and risen Saviour. None will ever perish while\nthey do this. The long, black catalogue of our delinquencies is before\nthe eye of the Infinite. The register is complete; none of our offenses\nare forgotten.

It is now that\nwe are to learn this lesson of prevailing prayer, of unyielding faith.\nThe greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual\nChristian are not those that are gained by talent or education, by\nwealth or the favor of men.

The beginning that led to results so\nterrible was the act of Jacob's daughter, who \"went out to see the\ndaughters of the land,\" thus venturing into association with the\nungodly.

As the\ncaravan journeyed southward toward the borders of Canaan, the boy could\ndiscern in the distance the hills among which lay his father's tents.\nBitterly he wept at thought of that loving father in his loneliness and\naffliction. Again the scene at Dothan came up before him. He saw his\nangry brothers and felt their fierce glances bent upon him. The\nstinging, insulting words that had met his agonized entreaties were\nringing in his ears. With a trembling heart he looked forward to the\nfuture. What a change in situation---from the tenderly cherished son to\nthe despised and helpless slave! Alone and friendless, what would be his\nlot in the strange land to which he was going? For a time Joseph gave\nhimself up to uncontrolled grief and terror. \u00a0{PP 213.1}",
                "But, in the providence of God, even this experience was to be a blessing\nto him. He had learned in a few hours that which years might not\notherwise have taught him. His father, strong and tender as his love had\nbeen, had done him wrong by his partiality and indulgence. This unwise\npreference had angered his brothers and provoked them to the cruel deed\nthat had separated him from his home. Its effects were manifest also in\nhis own character. Faults had been encouraged that were now to be\ncorrected. He was becoming self-sufficient and exacting. Accustomed to\nthe tenderness of his father's care, he felt that he was unprepared to\ncope with the difficulties before him, in the bitter, uncared-for life\nof a stranger and a slave. \u00a0{PP 213.2}",
                "Then his thoughts turned to his father's God. In his childhood he had\nbeen taught to love and fear Him. Often in his father's tent he had\nlistened to the story of the vision that Jacob saw as he fled from his\nhome an exile and a fugitive. He had been told of the Lord's promises to\nJacob, and how they had been fulfilled---how, in the hour of need, the\nangels of God had come \u00a0to instruct, comfort, and protect him. And he had\nlearned of the love of God in providing for men a Redeemer. Now all\nthese precious lessons came vividly before him. Joseph believed that the\nGod of his fathers would be his God. He then and there gave himself\nfully to the Lord, and he prayed that the Keeper of Israel would be with\nhim in the land of his exile. \u00a0{PP 213.3}",

The worship of false gods was surrounded by all the pomp of\nroyalty, supported by the wealth and culture of the most highly\ncivilized nation then in existence. Yet Joseph preserved his simplicity\nand his fidelity to God. The sights and sounds of vice were all about\nhim, but he was as one who saw and heard not. His thoughts were not\npermitted to linger upon forbidden subjects. The desire to gain the\nfavor of the Egyptians could not cause him to conceal his principles.\nHad he attempted to do this, he would have been overcome by temptation;\nbut he was not ashamed of the religion of his fathers, and he made no\neffort to hide the fact that he was a worshiper of Jehovah. \u00a0{PP 214.2}",

Without steadfast,\nwell-directed effort, however, success could never have been attained.\nGod was glorified by the faithfulness of His servant. It was His purpose\nthat in purity and uprightness the believer in God should appear in\nmarked contrast to the worshipers of idols---that thus the light of\nheavenly grace might shine forth amid the darkness of heathenism. \u00a0{PP\n214.4}",

Heretofore he had remained untainted by the corruption teeming\nin that heathen land; but this temptation, so sudden, so strong, so\nseductive---how should it be met? Joseph knew well what would be the\nconsequence of resistance. On the one hand were concealment, favor, and\nrewards; on the other, disgrace, imprisonment, perhaps death. His whole\nfuture life depended upon the decision of the moment. Would principle\ntriumph? Would Joseph still be true to God?

Under the\ninspecting eye of God and holy angels many take liberties of which they\nwould not be guilty in the presence of their fellow men, but Joseph's\nfirst thought was of God. \"How \\... can I do this great wickedness, and\nsin against God?\" he said. \u00a0{PP 217.3}",

But Joseph's real character shines\nout, even in the darkness of the dungeon. He held fast his faith and\npatience; his years of faithful service had been most cruelly repaid,\nyet this did not render him morose or distrustful. He had the peace that\ncomes from conscious innocence, and he trusted his case with God. He did\nnot brood upon his own wrongs, but forgot his sorrow in trying to\nlighten the sorrows of others. He found a work to do, even in the\nprison. God was preparing him in the school of affliction for greater\nusefulness, and he did not refuse the needful discipline.

And this\nperiod was to be followed by seven years of famine. \"And the plenty\nshall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for\nit shall be very grievous.\" The repetition of the dream was evidence\nboth of the certainty and nearness of the fulfillment. \"Now therefore,\"\nhe continued, \"let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him\nover the land of Egypt.

For some time the matter of the appointment was\nunder consideration.

In all the realm Joseph was the only man gifted with\nwisdom to point out the danger that threatened the kingdom and the\npreparation necessary to meet it; and the king was convinced that he was\nthe one best qualified to execute the plans which he had proposed. It\nwas evident that a divine power was with him, and that there were none\namong the king's officers of state so well qualified to conduct the\naffairs of the nation at this crisis. The fact that he was a Hebrew and\na slave was of little moment when weighed against his evident wisdom and\nsound judgment. \"Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the\nSpirit of God is?\" said the king to his counselors. \u00a0{PP 221.1}",
                "The appointment was decided upon, and to Joseph the astonishing\nannouncement was made, \"Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all this,\nthere is none so discreet and wise as thou art: thou shalt be over my\nhouse, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in\nthe throne will I be greater than thou.\" The king proceeded to invest\nJoseph with the insignia of his high office. \"And Pharaoh took off his\nring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in\nvestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; and he made\nhim to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before\nhim, Bow the knee.\" \u00a0{PP 221.2}",

As the tempest leaves unharmed the lowly flower of the valley,\nwhile it uproots the stately tree upon the mountaintop, so those who\nhave maintained their integrity in humble life may be dragged down to\nthe pit by the temptations that assail worldly success and honor. But\nJoseph's character bore the test alike of adversity and prosperity. The\nsame fidelity to God was manifest when he stood in the palace of the\nPharaohs as when in a prisoner's cell. He was still a stranger in a\nheathen land, separated from his kindred, the worshipers of God; but he\nfully believed that the divine hand had directed his steps, and in\nconstant reliance upon God he faithfully discharged the duties of his\nposition. Through Joseph the attention of the king and great men of\nEgypt was directed to the true God; and though they adhered to their\nidolatry, they learned to respect the principles revealed in the life\nand character of the worshiper of Jehovah. \u00a0{PP 222.1}",

Communion with God through His works and the\ncontemplation of the grand truths entrusted to the inheritors of faith\nhad elevated and ennobled his spiritual nature, broadening and\nstrengthening the mind as no other study could do. Faithful attention to\nduty in every station, from the lowliest to the most exalted, had been\ntraining every power for its highest service.

In his distress the\naged father exclaimed, \"Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is\nnot, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things\nare against me.\" Reuben answered, \"Slay my two sons, if I bring him not\nto thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.\"\nThis rash speech did not relieve the mind of Jacob. His answer was, \"My\nson shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left\nalone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall\nye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\" \u00a0{PP 226.2}",

The sons of Jacob\nwell knew that it would be in vain to return to Egypt without Benjamin.\nThey had little hope of changing their father's resolution, and they\nawaited the issue in silence. Deeper and deeper grew the shadow of\napproaching famine; in the anxious faces of all in the encampment the\nold man read their need; at last he said, \"Go again, buy us a little\nfood.\" \u00a0{PP 227.1}",

Upon\nbeing conducted to the governor's palace, the brothers were greatly\nalarmed, fearing that they were to be called to account for the money\nfound in their sacks. They thought that it might have been intentionally\nplaced there, to furnish occasion for making them slaves. In their\ndistress they consulted with the steward of the house, relating to him\nthe circumstances of their visit to Egypt; and in proof of their\ninnocence informed him that they had brought back the money found in\ntheir sacks, also other money to buy food; and they added, \"We cannot\ntell who put our money in our sacks.\" The man replied, \"Peace be to you,\nfear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure\nin your sacks: I had your money.\" Their anxiety was relieved, and when\nSimeon, who had been released from prison, joined them, they felt that\nGod was indeed gracious unto them. \u00a0{PP 227.4}",

Then his eye rested upon Benjamin, and he said,\n\"Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me?\" \"God be\ngracious unto thee, my son;\" but, overpowered by feelings of tenderness,\nhe could say no more. \"He entered into his chamber, and wept there.\" \u00a0{PP\n228.1}",
                "Having recovered his self-possession, he returned, and all proceeded to\nthe feast. By the laws of caste the Egyptians were forbidden to eat with\npeople of any other nation. The sons of Jacob had therefore a table by\nthemselves, while the governor, on account of his high rank, ate by\nhimself, and the Egyptians also had separate tables. When all were\nseated the brothers were surprised to see that they were arranged in\nexact order, according to their ages. Joseph \"sent messes unto them from\nbefore him;\" but Benjamin's was five times as much as any of theirs. By\nthis token of favor to Benjamin he hoped to ascertain if the youngest\nbrother was regarded with the envy and hatred that had been manifested\ntoward himself. Still supposing that Joseph did not \u00a0understand their\nlanguage, the brothers freely conversed with one another; thus he had a\ngood opportunity to learn their real feelings.

Both the people before the Flood and the\ndescendants of Noah cast off the divine authority. Then God entered into\ncovenant with Abraham, and took to Himself a people to become the\ndepositaries of His law. To seduce and destroy this people, Satan began\nat once to lay his snares. The children of Jacob were tempted to\ncontract marriages with the heathen and to worship their idols. But\nJoseph was faithful to God, and his fidelity was a constant testimony to\nthe true faith. It was to quench this light that Satan worked through\nthe envy of Joseph's brothers to cause him to be sold as a slave in a\nheathen land.

The Israelites in Egypt also became prosperous and wealthy, and\nsuch as were true to God exerted a widespread influence.

Here also the gross idolatry of the Egyptians and their cruelty\nand oppression during the latter part of the Hebrew sojourn should have\ninspired in them an abhorrence of idolatry, and should have led them to\nflee for refuge to the God of their fathers. This very providence Satan\nmade a means to serve his purpose, darkening the minds of the Israelites\nand leading them to imitate the practices of their heathen masters. On\naccount of the superstitious veneration in which animals were held by\nthe Egyptians, the Hebrews were not \u00a0permitted, during their bondage, to\npresent the sacrificial offerings. Thus their minds were not directed by\nthis service to the great Sacrifice, and their faith was weakened. When\nthe time came for Israel's deliverance, Satan set himself to resist the\npurposes of God.

The people whom God had promised to bless and multiply, to\nmake a power in the earth, and through whom He was to reveal the\nknowledge of His will---the people whom He was to make the keepers of\nHis law---this very people Satan was seeking to keep in obscurity and\nbondage, that he might obliterate from their minds the remembrance of\nGod. \u00a0{PP 333.3}",

By this signal honor He manifested His approval of their\nfidelity, both in adhering to His service and in executing His judgments\nwhen Israel apostatized in the worship of the golden calf. The\npriesthood, however, was restricted to the family of Aaron.

It extended\nnearly to the feet and was confined about the waist by a white linen\ngirdle embroidered in blue, purple, and red. A linen turban, or miter,\ncompleted his outer costume. Moses at the burning bush was directed to\nput off his sandals, for the ground whereon he stood was holy.

This was a time of intense interest to the worshipers\nwho assembled at the tabernacle. Before entering into the presence of\nGod through the ministration of the priest, they were to engage in\nearnest searching of heart and confession of sin. They united in silent\nprayer, with their faces toward the holy place. Thus their petitions\nascended with the cloud of incense, while faith laid hold upon the\nmerits of the promised Saviour prefigured by the atoning sacrifice. The\nhours appointed for the morning and the evening sacrifice \u00a0were regarded\nas sacred, and they came to be observed as the set time for worship\nthroughout the Jewish nation. And when in later times the Jews were\nscattered as captives in distant lands, they still at the appointed hour\nturned their faces toward Jerusalem and offered up their petitions to\nthe God of Israel. In this custom Christians have an example for morning\nand evening prayer. While God condemns a mere round of ceremonies,\nwithout the spirit of worship, He looks with great pleasure upon those\nwho love Him, bowing morning and evening to seek pardon for sins\ncommitted and to present their requests for needed blessings. \u00a0{PP 353.3}",

It was an acknowledgment of man's dependence upon God for both\ntemporal and spiritual food, and that it is received only through the\nmediation of Christ. God had fed Israel in the wilderness with bread\nfrom heaven, and they were still dependent upon His bounty, both for\ntemporal food and spiritual blessings. Both the manna and the showbread\npointed to Christ, the living Bread, who is ever in the presence of God\nfor us. He Himself said, \"I am the living Bread which came down from\nheaven.\" \u00a0John 6:48-51. Frankincense was placed upon the loaves.

The repentant sinner brought his\noffering to the door of the tabernacle, and, placing his hand upon the\nvictim's head, confessed his sins, thus in figure transferring them from\nhimself to the innocent sacrifice. By his own hand the animal was then\nslain, and the blood was carried by the priest into the holy place and\nsprinkled before the veil, behind which was the ark containing the law\nthat the sinner had transgressed. By this ceremony the sin was, through\nthe blood, transferred in figure to the sanctuary. In some cases the\nblood was not taken into the holy place; \\[See \u00a0Appendix, note 6.\\] but\nthe flesh was then to be eaten by the priest, as Moses directed the sons\nof Aaron, saying, \"God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the\ncongregation.\" \u00a0Leviticus 10:17.

It had only provided a\nmeans by which the sin was \u00a0transferred to the sanctuary. By the offering\nof blood, the sinner acknowledged the authority of the law, confessed\nthe guilt of his transgression, and expressed his faith in Him who was\nto take away the sin of the world; but he was not entirely released from\nthe condemnation of the law.

A solemn invocation marked both the halt and the\ndeparture. \"It came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,\nRise up, Lord, and let Thine enemies be scattered; and let them that\nhate Thee flee before Thee.

                "Yet it was almost with reluctance that many left the place where they\nhad so long encamped.

They loved\nto look upon the sacred mount, on whose hoary peaks and barren ridges\nthe divine glory had so often been displayed. The scene was so closely\nassociated with the presence of God and holy angels that it seemed too\nsacred to be left thoughtlessly, or even gladly. \u00a0{PP 376.4}",
                "At the signal from the trumpeters, however, the entire camp set forward,\nthe tabernacle borne in the midst, and each tribe in its appointed\nposition, under its own standard. All eyes were turned anxiously to see\nin what direction the cloud would lead. As it moved toward the east,\nwhere were only mountain masses huddled together, black and desolate, a\nfeeling of sadness and doubt arose in many hearts. \u00a0{PP 377.1}",
                "As they advanced, the way became more difficult. Their route lay through\nstony ravine and barren waste.

The rocky gorges, far and near, were thronged\nwith men, women, and children, with beasts and wagons, and long lines of\nflocks and herds.

                "After three days' journey open complaints were heard. These originated\nwith the mixed multitude, many of whom were not fully united with\nIsrael, and were continually watching for some cause of censure. The\ncomplainers were not pleased with the direction of the march, and they\nwere continually finding fault with the way in which \u00a0*Moses* \u00a0was leading\nthem, though they well knew that he, as well as they, was following the\nguiding cloud. Dissatisfaction is contagious, and it soon spread in the\nencampment. \u00a0{PP 377.3}",
                "Again they began to clamor for flesh to eat. Though abundantly supplied\nwith manna, they were not satisfied. The Israelites, during their\nbondage in Egypt, had been compelled to subsist on the plainest and\nsimplest food; but then keen appetite induced by privation and hard\nlabor had made it palatable. Many of the Egyptians, however, who were\nnow among them, had been accustomed to a luxurious diet; and these were\nthe \u00a0first to complain. At the giving of the manna, just before Israel\nreached Sinai, the Lord had granted them flesh in answer to their\nclamors; but it was furnished them for only one day. \u00a0{PP 377.4}",
                "God might as easily have provided them with flesh as with manna, but a\nrestriction was placed upon them for their good. It was His purpose to\nsupply them with food better suited to their wants than the feverish\ndiet to which many had become accustomed in Egypt. The perverted\nappetite was to be brought into a more healthy state, that they might\nenjoy the food originally provided for man---the fruits of the earth,\nwhich God gave to Adam and Eve in Eden. It was for this reason that the\nIsraelites had been deprived, in a great measure, of animal food. \u00a0{PP\n378.1}",
                "Satan tempted them to regard this restriction as unjust and cruel. He\ncaused them to lust after forbidden things, because he saw that the\nunrestrained indulgence of appetite would tend to produce sensuality,\nand by this means the people could be more easily brought under his\ncontrol. The author of disease and misery will assail men where he can\nhave the greatest success. Through temptations addressed to the appetite\nhe has, to a large extent, led men into sin from the time when he\ninduced Eve to eat of the forbidden fruit. It was by this same means\nthat he led Israel to murmur against God. Intemperance in eating and\ndrinking, leading as it does to the indulgence of the lower passions,\nprepares the way for men to disregard all moral obligations. When\nassailed by temptation, they have little power of resistance. \u00a0{PP 378.2}",

They would have had clear perceptions of truth and duty, keen\ndiscrimination, and sound judgment. But their unwillingness to submit to\nthe restrictions and requirements of God, prevented them, to a great\nextent, from reaching the high standard which He desired them to attain,\nand from receiving the blessings which He was ready to bestow upon\nthem. \u00a0{PP 378.3}",

Therefore the Lord heard this, and was\nwroth.\" \u00a0Psalm 78:18-21. Murmuring and tumults had been frequent during\nthe journey from the Red Sea to Sinai, but in pity for their ignorance\nand blindness God had not then visited the sin with judgments. But since\nthat time He had revealed Himself to them at Horeb. They had received\ngreat light, as they had been witnesses to the majesty, the power, and\nthe mercy of God; and their unbelief and discontent incurred the greater\nguilt. Furthermore, they had covenanted to accept Jehovah as their king\nand to obey His authority. Their murmuring was now rebellion, and as\nsuch it must receive prompt and signal punishment, if Israel was to be\npreserved from anarchy and ruin. \"The fire of Jehovah burnt among them,\nand consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.\" The\nmost guilty of the complainers were slain by lightning from the\ncloud. \u00a0{PP 379.1}",

In his love for them he had prayed that his \u00a0name might be\nblotted from the book of life rather than that they should be left to\nperish. He had imperiled all for them, and this was their response. All\ntheir hardships, even their imaginary sufferings, they charged upon him;\nand their wicked murmurings made doubly heavy the burden of care and\nresponsibility under which he staggered. In his distress he was tempted\neven to distrust God. His prayer was almost a complaint. \"Wherefore hast\nThou afflicted Thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in Thy\nsight, that Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? \\...\nwhence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep\nunto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

Moses \"was very meek, above all the men\nwhich were upon the face of the earth,\" and this is why he was granted\ndivine wisdom and guidance above all others.

Christ, the true\nRock, was with them in all their wanderings. \"They thirsted not when He\nled them through the deserts: He caused the waters to flow out of the\nrock for them; He clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.\" \"They\nran in the dry places like a river.\" \u00a0Isaiah 48:21; \u00a0Psalm 105:41. \u00a0{PP\n411.2}",

As the rock had been once\nsmitten, so Christ was to be \"once offered to bear the sins of\nmany.\" \u00a0Hebrews 9:28. Our Saviour was not to be sacrificed a second time;\nand it is only necessary for those who seek the blessings of His grace\nto ask in the name of Jesus, pouring forth the heart's desire in\npenitential prayer. Such prayer will bring before the Lord of hosts the\nwounds of Jesus, and then will flow forth afresh the life-giving blood,\nsymbolized by the flowing of the living water for Israel. \u00a0{PP 411.3}",
                "The flowing of the water from the rock in the desert was celebrated by\nthe Israelites, after their establishment in Canaan, with demonstrations\nof great rejoicing. In the time of Christ this celebration had become a\nmost impressive ceremony. It took place on the occasion of the Feast of\nTabernacles, when the people from all the land were assembled at\nJerusalem. On each of the seven days of the feast the priests went out\nwith music and the choir of Levites to draw water in a golden vessel\nfrom the spring of Siloam. They were followed by multitudes of the\nworshipers, as many as could get near the stream drinking of it, while\nthe jubilant strains arose, \"With joy shall ye draw water out of the\nwells of salvation.\" \u00a0Isaiah 12:3. Then the water drawn by the priests\nwas borne to the temple amid the sounding of trumpets and the solemn\nchant, \"Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.\" \u00a0Psalm\n122:2. The water was poured out upon the altar of burnt offering, while\nsongs of praise rang out, the multitudes joining in triumphant chorus\nwith musical instruments and deep-toned trumpets. \u00a0{PP 412.1}",

The refreshing water, welling up in a parched\nand barren land, causing the desert place to blossom, and flowing out to\ngive life to the perishing, is an emblem of the divine grace which\nChrist alone can bestow, and which is as the living water, purifying,\nrefreshing, and invigorating the soul. He in whom Christ is abiding has\nwithin him a never-failing fountain of grace and strength. Jesus cheers\nthe life and brightens the path of all who truly seek Him . His love,\nreceived into the heart, will spring up in good works unto eternal life.\nAnd not only does it bless the soul in which it springs, but the living\nstream will flow out in words and deeds of righteousness, to refresh the\nthirsting around him. \u00a0{PP 412.2}",

Ye\nshall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy\nwater of them for money, that ye may drink.\" \u00a0Deuteronomy 2:3-6. These\ndirections should have been sufficient to explain why their supply of\nwater had been cut off; they were about to pass through a well-watered,\nfertile country, in a direct course to the land of Canaan. God had\npromised them an unmolested passage through Edom, and an opportunity to\npurchase food, and also water sufficient to supply the host. The\ncessation of the miraculous flow of water should therefore have been a\ncause of rejoicing, a token that the wilderness wandering was ended. Had\nthey not been blinded by their unbelief, they would have understood\nthis. But that which should have been an evidence of the fulfillment of\nGod's promise was made the occasion of doubt and murmuring.

Moses had spoken from irritated feeling; his words\nwere an expression of human passion rather than of holy indignation\nbecause God had been dishonored. \"Hear now, ye rebels,\" he said. This\naccusation was true, but even truth is not to be spoken in passion or\nimpatience. When God had bidden Moses to charge upon Israel their\nrebellion, the words had been painful to him, and hard for them to bear,\nyet God had sustained him in delivering the message. But when he took it\nupon himself to accuse them, he grieved the Spirit of God and wrought\nonly harm to the people. His lack of patience and self-control was\nevident. Thus the people were given occasion to question whether his\npast course had been under the direction of God, and to excuse their own\nsins. Moses, as well as they, had offended God. His course, they said,\nhad from the first been open to criticism and censure.

The first generation had been condemned to\nperish \u00a0in the wilderness because of their unbelief, yet the same spirit\nappeared in their children. Would these also fail of receiving the\npromise? Wearied and disheartened, Moses and Aaron had made no effort to\nstem the current of popular feeling.

Had\nMoses and Aaron been cherishing self-esteem or indulging a passionate\nspirit in the face of divine warning and reproof, their guilt would have\nbeen far greater. But they were not chargeable with willful or\ndeliberate sin; they had been overcome by a sudden temptation, and their\ncontrition was immediate and heartfelt.

He told them how he had pleaded with God for a remission of\nthe sentence, and had been refused. \"The Lord was wroth with me for your\nsakes,\" he said, \"and would not hear me.\" \u00a0Deuteronomy 3:26. \u00a0{PP 419.2}",

It is\nnot I, but God, who has wrought in your deliverance.\" But his hasty\nwords before the rock, \"shall \u00a0*we* \u00a0bring water?\" were a virtual\nadmission of their charge, and would thus confirm them in their unbelief\nand justify their murmurings. The Lord would remove this impression\nforever from their minds, by forbidding Moses to enter the Promised\nLand.

                "Had they in this manner passed through Edom, as God had purposed, the\npassage would have proved a blessing, not only to themselves, but to the\ninhabitants of the land; for it would have given them an opportunity to\nbecome acquainted with God's people and His worship and to witness how\nthe God of Jacob prospered those who loved and feared Him . But all this\nthe unbelief of Israel had prevented. God had given the people water in\nanswer to their clamors, but He permitted their unbelief to work out its\npunishment. Again they must traverse the desert and quench their thirst\nfrom the miraculous spring, which, had they but trusted in Him , they\nwould no longer have needed. \u00a0{PP 424.2}",
                "Accordingly the hosts of Israel again turned toward the south, and made\ntheir way over sterile wastes, that seemed even more dreary after a\nglimpse of the green spots among the hills and valleys of Edom. From the\nmountain range overlooking this gloomy desert, rises Mount Hor, whose\nsummit was to be the place of Aaron's death and burial. When the\nIsraelites came to this mountain, the divine command was addressed to\nMoses--- \u00a0{PP 424.3}",

They were men of great natural ability, and all their powers had\nbeen developed, exalted, and dignified by communion with the Infinite\nOne.

The ascent was steep and toilsome; and as\nthey often paused to rest, they communed together of the past and the\nfuture. Before them, as far as the eye could reach, was spread out the\nscene of their desert wanderings. In the plain below were encamped the\nvast hosts of Israel, for whom these chosen men had spent the best\nportion of their lives; for whose welfare they had felt so deep an\ninterest, and made so great sacrifices. Somewhere beyond the mountains\nof Edom was the path leading to the Promised Land---that land whose\nblessings Moses and Aaron were not to enjoy. No rebellious feelings\nfound a place in their hearts, no expression of murmuring escaped their\nlips; yet a solemn sadness rested upon their countenances as they\nremembered what had debarred them from the inheritance of their\nfathers. \u00a0{PP 425.3}",
                "Aaron's work for Israel was done. Forty years before, at the age of\neighty-three, God had called him to unite with Moses in his great and\nimportant mission. He had co-operated with his brother in leading the\nchildren of Israel from Egypt. He had held up the great leader's hands\nwhen the Hebrew hosts gave battle to Amalek. He had been permitted to\nascend Mount Sinai, to approach into the presence of God, and to behold\nthe divine glory. The Lord had conferred upon the family of Aaron\nthe \u00a0office of the priesthood, and had honored him with the sacred\nconsecration of high priest. He had sustained him in the holy office by\nthe terrible manifestations of divine judgment in the destruction of\nKorah and his company. It was through Aaron's intercession that the\nplague was stayed. When his two sons were slain for disregarding God's\nexpress command, he did not rebel or even murmur. Yet the record of his\nnoble life had been marred. Aaron committed a grievous sin when he\nyielded to the clamors of the people and made the golden calf at Sinai;\nand again, when he united with Miriam in envy and murmuring against\nMoses.

He came forth from that work to bless the\ncongregation, as Christ will come forth to bless His waiting people when\nHis work of atonement in their behalf shall be ended. It was the exalted\ncharacter of that sacred office as representative of our great High\nPriest that made Aaron's sin at Kadesh of so great magnitude. \u00a0{PP 426.1}",

Moses was\nto continue to bear his burden in leading the people to the very borders\nof Canaan. He was to come within sight of the Promised Land, but was not\nto enter it. Had these servants of God, when they stood before the rock\nat Kadesh, borne unmurmuringly the test there brought upon them, how\ndifferent would have been their future!

As the people looked about them,\nupon their vast congregation, they saw that nearly all the adults who\nleft Egypt had perished in the wilderness. All felt a foreboding of evil\nas they remembered the sentence pronounced against Moses and Aaron. Some\nwere aware of the object of that mysterious journey to the summit of\nMount Hor, and their solicitude for their leaders was heightened by\nbitter memories and self-accusings. \u00a0{PP 426.3}",

As the people with heavy hearts gathered about their\nleader, Moses told them that Aaron had died in his arms upon Mount Hor,\nand that they there buried him. The congregation broke forth in mourning\nand lamentation, for they all loved Aaron, though they had so often\ncaused him sorrow. \"They mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the\nhouse of Israel.\" \u00a0{PP 427.1}",

In what striking contrast to the customs of\nthe present day was this burial, conducted according to the express\ncommand of God. In modern times the funeral services of a man of high\nposition are often made the occasion of ostentatious and extravagant\ndisplay. When Aaron died, one of the most illustrious men that ever\nlived, there were only two of his nearest friends to witness his death\nand to attend his burial. And that lonely grave upon Mount Hor was\nforever hidden from the sight of Israel. God is not honored in the great\ndisplay so often made over the dead, and the extravagant expense\nincurred in returning their bodies to the dust. \u00a0{PP 427.2}",

This victory, instead of inspiring gratitude and leading\nthe people to feel their dependence upon God, made them boastful and\nself-confident. Soon they fell into the old habit of murmuring. They\nwere now dissatisfied because the armies of Israel had not been\npermitted to advance upon Canaan immediately after their rebellion at\nthe report of the spies nearly forty years before.

Their hearts should have been filled with\ngratitude to Him that He had punished their sin so lightly. But instead\nof this, they flattered themselves that if God and Moses had not\ninterfered, they might now have been in possession of the Promised Land.\nAfter bringing trouble upon themselves, making their lot altogether\nharder than God designed, they charged all their misfortunes upon Him.\nThus they cherished bitter thoughts concerning His dealings with them,\nand finally they became discontented with everything.

In all the way of God's\nleading they had found water to refresh the thirsty, bread from heaven\nto satisfy their hunger, and peace and safety under the shadowy cloud by\nday and the pillar of fire by night. Angels had ministered to them as\nthey climbed the rocky heights or threaded the rugged paths of the\nwilderness. Notwithstanding the hardships they had endured, there was\nnot a feeble one in all their ranks. Their feet had not swollen in their\nlong journeys, neither had their clothes grown old.

Heretofore many had brought their offerings to God, and had\nfelt that in so doing they made ample atonement for their sins. They did\nnot rely upon the Redeemer to come, of whom these offerings were only a\ntype.

He now conducted\nBalaam to Mount Peor, where was a temple devoted to the licentious\nworship of Baal, their god. Here the same number of altars were erected\nas before, and the same number of sacrifices were offered; but Balaam\nwent not alone, as at other times, to learn God's will. He made no\npretense of sorcery, but standing beside the altars, he looked abroad\nupon the tents of Israel.

The figure last mentioned is one of the most strikingly\nbeautiful and appropriate to be found in the inspired word. The cedar of\nLebanon was honored by all the people of the East. The class of trees to\nwhich it belongs is found wherever man has gone throughout the earth.\nFrom the arctic regions to the tropic zone they flourish, rejoicing in\nthe heat, yet braving the cold; springing in rich luxuriance by the\nriverside, yet towering aloft upon the parched and thirsty waste. They\nplant their roots deep among the rocks of the mountains and boldly stand\nin defiance of the tempest. Their leaves are fresh and green when all\nelse has perished at the breath of winter. Above all other trees the\ncedar of Lebanon is distinguished for its strength, its firmness, its\nundecaying vigor; and this is used as a symbol of those whose life is\n\"hid with Christ in God.\" \u00a0Colossians 3:3. Says the Scripture, \"The\nrighteous \\... shall grow like a cedar.\" \u00a0Psalm 92:12.

Nature has affixed terrible\npenalties to these crimes---penalties which, sooner or later, will be\ninflicted upon every transgressor. It is these sins more than any other\nthat have caused the fearful degeneracy of our race, and the weight of\ndisease and misery with which the world is cursed. Men may succeed in\nconcealing their transgression from their fellow men, but they will no\nless surely reap the result, in suffering, disease, imbecility, or\ndeath.

                "The Hebrews had entered Canaan, but they had not subdued it; and to\nhuman appearance the struggle to gain possession of the land must be\nlong and difficult. It was inhabited by a powerful race, who stood ready\nto oppose the invasion of their territory. The various tribes were bound\ntogether by the fear of a common danger. Their horses and iron battle\nchariots, their knowledge of the country, and their training in war,\nwould give them great advantage. Furthermore, the country was guarded by\nfortresses---\"cities great and fenced up to heaven.\" \u00a0Deuteronomy 9:1.\nOnly in the assurance of a strength not their own could the Israelites\nhope for success in the impending conflict. \u00a0{PP 487.1}",
                "One of the strongest fortresses in the land---the large and wealthy city\nof Jericho---lay just before them, but a little distance from their camp\nat Gilgal. On the border of a fertile plain abounding with the rich and\nvaried productions of the tropics, its palaces and temples the abode of\nluxury and vice, this proud city, behind its massive battlements,\noffered defiance to the God of Israel. Jericho was one of the principal\nseats of idol worship, being especially devoted to Ashtaroth, the\ngoddess of the moon. Here centered all that was vilest and most\ndegrading in the religion of the Canaanites. The people of Israel, in\nwhose minds were fresh the fearful results of their sin at Beth-peor,\ncould look upon this heathen city only with disgust and horror. \u00a0{PP\n487.2}",
                "To reduce Jericho was seen by Joshua to be the first step in the\nconquest of Canaan. But first of all he sought an assurance of divine\nguidance, and it was granted him. Withdrawing from the encampment to\nmeditate and to pray that the God of Israel would go before His people,\nhe beheld an armed warrior, of lofty stature and commanding presence,\n\"with his sword drawn in his hand.\" To Joshua's challenge, \"Art thou for\nus, or for \u00a0our adversaries?\" the answer was given, \"As Captain of the\nhost of the Lord am I now come.\" The same command given to Moses in\nHoreb, \"Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou\nstandest is holy,\" revealed the true character of the mysterious\nstranger. It was Christ, the Exalted One, who stood before the leader of\nIsrael. Awe-stricken, Joshua fell upon his face and worshiped, and heard\nthe assurance, \"I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king\nthereof, and the mighty men of valor,\" and he received instruction for\nthe capture of the city. \u00a0{PP 487.3}",
                "In obedience to the divine command Joshua marshaled the armies of\nIsrael. No assault was to be made. They were simply to make the circuit\nof the city, bearing the ark of God and blowing upon trumpets. First\ncame the warriors, a body of chosen men, not now to conquer by their own\nskill and prowess, but by obedience to the directions given them from\nGod. Seven priests with trumpets followed. Then the ark of God,\nsurrounded by a halo of divine glory, was borne by priests clad in the\ndress denoting their sacred office. The army of Israel followed, each\ntribe under its standard. Such was the procession that compassed the\ndoomed city. No sound was heard but the tread of that mighty host and\nthe solemn peal of the trumpets, echoing among the hills and resounding\nthrough the streets of Jericho. The circuit completed, the army returned\nin silence to their tents, and the ark was restored to its place in the\ntabernacle. \u00a0{PP 488.1}",
                "With wonder and alarm the watchmen of the city marked every move, and\nreported to those in authority. They knew not the meaning of all this\ndisplay; but when they beheld that mighty host marching around their\ncity once each day, with the sacred ark and the attendant priests, the\nmystery of the scene struck terror to the hearts of priest and people.\nAgain they would inspect their strong defenses, feeling certain they\ncould successfully resist the most powerful attack. Many ridiculed the\nthought that any harm could come to them through these singular\ndemonstrations. Others were awed as they beheld the procession that each\nday wound about the city. They remembered that the Red Sea had once\nparted before this people, and that a passage had just been opened for\nthem through the river Jordan. They knew not what further wonders God\nmight work for them. \u00a0{PP 488.2}",
                "For six days the host of Israel made the circuit of the city. The\nseventh day came, and with the first dawn of light, Joshua marshaled the\narmies of the Lord. Now they were directed to \u00a0march seven times around\nJericho, and at a mighty peal from the trumpets to shout with a loud\nvoice, for God had given them the city. \u00a0{PP 488.3}",
                "The vast army marched solemnly around the devoted walls. All was silent,\nsave the measured tread of many feet, and the occasional sound of the\ntrumpet, breaking the stillness of the early morning. The massive walls\nof solid stone seemed to defy the siege of men. The watchers on the\nwalls looked on with rising fear, as, the first circuit ended, there\nfollowed a second, then a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth. What could\nbe the object of these mysterious movements? What mighty event was\nimpending? They had not long to wait. As the seventh circuit was\ncompleted, the long procession paused, The trumpets, which for an\ninterval had been silent, now broke forth in a blast that shook the very\nearth. The walls of solid stone, with their massive towers and\nbattlements, tottered and heaved from their foundations, and with a\ncrash fell in ruin to the earth. The inhabitants of Jericho were\nparalyzed with terror, and the hosts of Israel marched in and took\npossession of the city. \u00a0{PP 491.1}",
                "The Israelites had not gained the victory by their own power; the\nconquest had been wholly the Lord's; and as the first fruits of the\nland, the city, with all that it contained, was to be devoted as a\nsacrifice to God. It was to be impressed upon Israel that in the\nconquest of Canaan they were not to fight for themselves, but simply as\ninstruments to execute the will of God; not to seek for riches or\nself-exaltation, but the glory of Jehovah their King. Before the capture\nthe command had been given, \"The city shall be accursed, even it, and\nall that are therein.\" \"Keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye\nmake yourselves accursed \\... and make the camp of Israel a curse, and\ntrouble it.\" \u00a0{PP 491.2}",
                "All the inhabitants of the city, with every living thing that it\ncontained, \"both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and\nass,\" were put to the sword. Only faithful Rahab, with her household,\nwas spared, in fulfillment of the promise of the spies. The city itself\nwas burned; its palaces and temples, its magnificent dwellings with all\ntheir luxurious appointments, the rich draperies and the costly\ngarments, were given to the flames. That which could not be destroyed by\nfire, \"the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron,\"\nwas to be devoted to the service of the tabernacle. The very site of the\ncity was accursed; Jericho was never to be rebuilt \u00a0as a stronghold;\njudgments were threatened upon anyone who should presume to restore the\nwalls that divine power had cast down. The solemn declaration was made\nin the presence of all Israel, \"Cursed be the man before the Lord, that\nriseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation\nthereof in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up the\ngates of it.\" \u00a0{PP 491.3}",
                "The utter destruction of the people of Jericho was but a fulfillment of\nthe commands previously given through Moses concerning the inhabitants\nof Canaan: \"Thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy\nthem.\" \u00a0Deuteronomy 7:2. \"Of the cities of these people, \\... thou shalt\nsave alive nothing that breatheth.\" \u00a0Deuteronomy 20:16. To many these\ncommands seem to be contrary to the spirit of love and mercy enjoined in\nother portions of the Bible, but they were in truth the dictates of\ninfinite wisdom and goodness. God was about to establish Israel in\nCanaan, to develop among them a nation and government that should be a\nmanifestation of His kingdom upon the earth. They were not only to be\ninheritors of the true religion, but to disseminate its principles\nthroughout the world. The Canaanites had abandoned themselves to the\nfoulest and most debasing heathenism, and it was necessary that the land\nshould be cleared of what would so surely prevent the fulfillment of\nGod's gracious purposes. \u00a0{PP 492.1}",
                "The inhabitants of Canaan had been granted ample opportunity for\nrepentance. Forty years before, the opening of the Red Sea and the\njudgments upon Egypt had testified to the supreme power of the God of\nIsrael. And now the overthrow of the kings of Midian, of Gilead and\nBashan, had further shown that Jehovah was above all gods. The holiness\nof His character and His abhorrence of impurity had been evinced in the\njudgments visited upon Israel for their participation in the abominable\nrites of Baalpeor. All these events were known to the inhabitants of\nJericho, and there were many who shared Rahab's conviction, though they\nrefused to obey it, that Jehovah, the God of Israel, \"is God in heaven\nabove, and upon the earth beneath.\" Like the men before the Flood, the\nCanaanites lived only to blaspheme Heaven and defile the earth. And both\nlove and justice demanded the prompt execution of these rebels against\nGod and foes to man. \u00a0{PP 492.2}",
                "How easily the armies of heaven brought down the walls of \u00a0Jericho, that\nproud city whose bulwarks, forty years before, had struck terror to the\nunbelieving spies! The Mighty One of Israel had said, \"I have given into\nthine hand Jericho.\" Against that word human strength was powerless. \u00a0{PP\n492.3}",
                "\"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down.\" \u00a0Hebrews 11:30. The Captain of\nthe Lord's host communicated only with Joshua; He did not reveal Himself\nto all the congregation, and it rested with them to believe or doubt the\nwords of Joshua, to obey the commands given by him in the name of the\nLord, or to deny his authority. \u00a0*They* \u00a0could not see the host of angels\nwho attended them under the leadership of the Son of God. They might\nhave reasoned: \"What unmeaning movements are these, and how ridiculous\nthe performance of marching daily around the walls of the city, blowing\ntrumpets of rams' horns. This can have no effect upon those towering\nfortifications.\" But the very plan of continuing this ceremony through\nso long a time prior to the final overthrow of the walls afforded\nopportunity for the development of faith among the Israelites. It was to\nbe impressed upon their minds that their strength was not in the wisdom\nof man, nor in his might, but only in the God of their salvation. They\nwere thus to become accustomed to relying wholly upon their divine\nLeader. \u00a0{PP 493.1}",
                "God will do great things for those who trust in Him. The reason why His\nprofessed people have no greater strength is that they trust so much to\ntheir own wisdom, and do not give the Lord an opportunity to reveal His\npower in their behalf. He will help His believing children in every\nemergency if they will place their entire confidence in Him and\nfaithfully obey Him. \u00a0{PP 493.2}",
                "Soon after the fall of Jericho, Joshua determined to attack Ai, a small\ntown among the ravines a few miles to the west of the Jordan Valley.\nSpies sent to this place brought back the report that the inhabitants\nwere but few, and that only a small force would be needed to overthrow\nit. \u00a0{PP 493.3}",
                "The great victory that God had gained for them had made the Israelites\nself-confident. Because He had promised them the land of Canaan they\nfelt secure, and failed to realize that divine help alone could give\nthem success. Even Joshua laid his plans for the conquest of Ai without\nseeking counsel from God. \u00a0{PP 493.4}",
                "The Israelites had begun to exalt their own strength and to look with\ncontempt upon their foes. An easy victory was expected, and three\nthousand men were thought sufficient to take \u00a0the place. These rushed to\nthe attack without the assurance that God would be with them. They\nadvanced nearly to the gate of the city, only to encounter the most\ndetermined resistance. Panic-stricken at the numbers and thorough\npreparation of their enemies, they fled in confusion down the steep\ndescent. The Canaanites were in hot pursuit; \"they chased them from\nbefore the gate, \\... and smote them in the going down.\" Though the loss\nwas small as to numbers---but thirty-six men being slain---the defeat\nwas disheartening to the whole congregation. \"The hearts of the people\nmelted, and became as water.\" This was the first time they had met the\nCanaanites in actual battle, and if put to flight before the defenders\nof this little town, what would be the result in the greater conflicts\nbefore them? Joshua looked upon their ill success as an expression of\nGod's displeasure, and in distress and apprehension he \"rent his\nclothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the Lord\nuntil the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their\nheads.\" \u00a0{PP 493.5}",

The lot was to be employed\nfor the detection of the guilty.

Closer and still closer came the fearful test.\nFirst the tribe, then the family, then the household, then the man was\ntaken, and Achan the son of Carmi, of the tribe of Judah, was pointed\nout by the finger of God as the troubler of Israel. \u00a0{PP 495.1}",
                "To establish his guilt beyond all question, leaving no ground for the\ncharge that he had been unjustly condemned, Joshua solemnly adjured\nAchan to acknowledge the truth.

It had been followed by the\noverthrow of Jericho, giving evidence of the destruction which will\nsurely overtake all transgressors of God's law. The fact that divine\npower alone had given the victory to Israel, that they had not come into\npossession of Jericho by their own strength, gave solemn weight to the\ncommand prohibiting them from partaking of the spoils.

How common even\nhere to find selfishness, avarice, overreaching, neglect of charities,\nand robbery of God \"in tithes and offerings.\" Among church members \"in\ngood and regular standing\" there are, alas! many Achans. Many a man\ncomes statedly to church, and sits at the table of the Lord, while among\nhis possessions are hidden unlawful gains, the things that God has\ncursed. For a goodly Babylonish garment, multitudes sacrifice the\napproval of conscience and their hope of heaven. Multitudes barter their\nintegrity, and their capabilities for usefulness, for a bag of silver\nshekels.

The fact that the altar was set up on Mount Ebal,\nthe mountain upon which the curse was put, was significant, denoting\nthat because of their transgressions of God's law, Israel had justly\nincurred His wrath, and that it would be at once visited, but for the\natonement of Christ, represented by the altar of sacrifice. \u00a0{PP 500.2}",

These were at first very humble, and not always pleasant; but\nthey were performed to the best of his ability, and with a willing\nheart. His religion was carried into every duty of life. He regarded\nhimself as God's servant, and his work as God's work. His efforts were\naccepted, because they were prompted by love to God and a sincere desire\nto do His will.

                "Eli was priest and judge in Israel. He held the highest and most\nresponsible positions among the people of God. As a man divinely chosen\nfor the sacred duties of the priesthood, and set over the land as the\nhighest judicial authority, he was looked up to as an example, and he\nwielded a great influence over the tribes of Israel. But although he had\nbeen appointed to govern the people, he did not rule his own household.\nEli was an indulgent father. Loving peace and ease, he did not exercise\nhis authority to correct the evil habits and passions of his children.\nRather than contend with them or punish them, he would submit to their\nwill and give them their own way. Instead of regarding the education of\nhis sons as one of the most important of his responsibilities, he\ntreated the matter as of little consequence. The priest and judge of\nIsrael had not been left in darkness as to the duty of restraining and\ngoverning the children that God had given to his care. But Eli shrank\nfrom this duty, because it involved crossing the will of his sons, and\nwould make it necessary to punish and deny them. Without weighing the\nterrible consequences that would follow his course, he indulged his\nchildren in whatever they desired and neglected the work of fitting them\nfor the service of God and the duties of life. \u00a0{PP 575.1}",
                "God had said of Abraham, \"I know him, that he will \u00a0*command* \u00a0his\nchildren and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the\nLord, to do justice and judgment.\" \u00a0Genesis 18:19. But Eli allowed his\nchildren to control him. The father became subject to the children. The\ncurse of transgression was apparent in the corruption and evil that\nmarked the course of his sons. They had no proper appreciation of the\ncharacter of God or of the sacredness of His law. His service was to\nthem a common thing. From childhood they had been accustomed to the\nsanctuary and its service; but instead of becoming more reverent, \u00a0they\nhad lost all sense of its holiness and significance. The father had not\ncorrected their want of reverence for his authority, had not checked\ntheir disrespect for the solemn services of the sanctuary; and when they\nreached manhood, they were full of the deadly fruits of skepticism and\nrebellion. \u00a0{PP 575.2}",
                "Though wholly unfit for the office, they were placed as priests in the\nsanctuary to minister before God. The Lord had given the most specific\ndirections in regard to offering sacrifices; but these wicked men\ncarried their disregard of authority into the service of God, and did\nnot give attention to the law of the offerings, which were to be made in\nthe most solemn manner. The sacrifices, pointing forward to the death of\nChrist, were designed to preserve in the hearts of the people faith in\nthe Redeemer to come; hence it was of the greatest importance that the\nLord's directions concerning them should be strictly heeded. The peace\nofferings were especially an expression of thanksgiving to God. In these\nofferings the fat alone was to be burned upon the altar; a certain\nspecified portion was reserved for the priests, but the greater part was\nreturned to the offerer, to be eaten by him and his friends in a\nsacrificial feast. Thus all hearts were to be directed, in gratitude and\nfaith, to the great Sacrifice that was to take away the sin of the\nworld. \u00a0{PP 576.1}",
                "The sons of Eli, instead of realizing the solemnity of this symbolic\nservice, only thought how they could make it a means of self-indulgence.\nNot content with the part of the peace offerings allotted them, they\ndemanded an additional portion; and the great number of these sacrifices\npresented at the annual feasts gave the priests an opportunity to enrich\nthemselves at the expense of the people. They not only demanded more\nthan their right, but refused to wait even until the fat had been burned\nas an offering to God. They persisted in claiming whatever portion\npleased them, and, if denied, threatened to take it by violence. \u00a0{PP\n576.2}",
                "This irreverence on the part of the priests soon robbed the service of\nits holy and solemn significance, and the people \"abhorred the offering\nof the Lord.\" The great antitypical sacrifice to which they were to look\nforward was no longer recognized. \"Wherefore the sin of the young men\nwas very great before the Lord.\" \u00a0{PP 576.3}",

The people complained of\ntheir violent deeds, and the high priest was grieved and distressed. He\ndared remain silent no longer. But his sons had been brought up to think\nof no one but themselves, and now they cared for no one else. They saw\nthe grief of their father, but their hard hearts were not touched. They\nheard his mild admonitions, but they were not impressed, nor would they\nchange their evil course though warned of the consequences of their\nsins. Had Eli dealt justly with his wicked sons, they would have been\nrejected from the priestly office and punished with death. Dreading thus\nto bring public disgrace and condemnation upon them, he sustained them\nin the most sacred positions of trust. He still permitted them to mingle\ntheir corruption with the holy service of God and to inflict upon the\ncause of truth an injury which years could not efface.

He should first have attempted to restrain evil\nby mild measures; but if these did not avail, he should have subdued the\nwrong by the severest means. He incurred the Lord's displeasure by not\nreproving sin and executing justice upon the sinner. He could not be\ndepended upon to keep Israel pure. Those who have too little courage to\nreprove wrong, or who through indolence or lack of interest make no\nearnest effort to purify the family or the church of God, are held\naccountable for the evil that may result from their neglect of duty.

If children are\nindulged in evil practices, while the parents make a profession of\nreligion, the truth of God is brought into reproach. The best test of\nthe Christianity of a home is the type of character begotten by its\ninfluence. Actions speak louder than the most positive profession of\ngodliness. If professors of religion, instead of putting forth earnest,\npersistent, and painstaking effort to bring up a well-ordered household\nas a witness to the benefits of faith in God, are lax in their\ngovernment and indulgent to the evil desires of their children, they are\ndoing as did Eli, and are bringing disgrace on the cause of Christ and\nruin upon themselves and their households.

Like Hophni and Phinehas,\nthey cause men to \"abhor the offering of the Lord.\" They may pursue\ntheir evil course in secret for a time; but when at last their true\ncharacter is exposed, the faith of the people receives a shock that\noften results in destroying their confidence in religion.

The Bible is the most instructive history that men possess.\nIt came fresh from the fountain of eternal truth, and a divine hand has\npreserved its purity through all the ages. It lights up the far-distant\npast, where human research seeks vainly to penetrate. In God's word we\nbehold the power that laid the foundation of the earth and that\nstretched out the heavens. Here only can we find a history of our race\nunsullied by human prejudice or human pride. Here are recorded the\nstruggles, the defeats, and the victories of the greatest men this world\nhas ever known. Here the great problems of duty and destiny are\nunfolded. The curtain that separates the visible from the invisible\nworld is lifted, and we behold the conflict of the opposing forces of\ngood and evil, from the first entrance of sin to the final triumph of\nrighteousness and truth; and all is but a revelation of the character of\nGod. In the reverent contemplation of the truths presented in His word\nthe mind of the student is brought into communion with the infinite\nmind.

There is no position in life, no phase of human\nexperience, for which the teaching of the Bible is not an essential\npreparation. Studied and obeyed, the word of God would give to the world\nmen of stronger and more active intellect than will the closest\napplication to all the subjects that human philosophy embraces.

The tribe, the\nfamily, and the household were successively designated, and then Saul,\nthe son of Kish, was pointed out as the individual chosen. But Saul was\nnot in the assembly. Burdened with a sense of the great responsibility\nabout to fall upon him, he had secretly withdrawn. He was brought back\nto the congregation, who observed with pride and satisfaction that he\nwas of kingly bearing and noble form, being \"higher than any of the\npeople from his shoulders and upward.\" Even Samuel, when presenting him\nto the assembly, exclaimed, \"See ye him whom the Lord hath chosen, that\nthere is none like him among all the people?\" And in response arose from\nthe vast throng one long, loud shout of joy, \"God save the king!\" \u00a0{PP\n611.1}",

They refused to profess allegiance to\nSaul or to bring \u00a0him the customary presents. Those who had been most\nurgent in their demand for a king were the very ones that refused to\naccept with gratitude the man of God's appointment. The members of each\nfaction had their favorite, whom they wished to see placed on the\nthrone, and several among the leaders had desired the honor for\nthemselves.

In\ntheir enthusiasm some proposed to put to death those who had at first\nrefused to acknowledge the authority of Saul. But the king interfered,\nsaying, \"There shall not a man be put to death this day: for today the\nLord hath wrought salvation in Israel.\" Here Saul gave evidence of the\nchange that had taken place in his character.

The command to refrain from food was prompted by\nselfish ambition, and it showed the king to be indifferent to the needs\nof his people when these conflicted with his desire for self-exaltation.\nTo confirm his prohibition by a solemn oath showed Saul to be both rash\nand profane.

                "It is a perilous step to slight the reproofs and warnings of God's word\nor of His Spirit. Many, like Saul, yield to temptation until they become\nblind to the true character of sin. They flatter themselves that they\nhave had some good object in view, and have done no wrong in departing\nfrom the Lord's requirements. Thus they do despite to the Spirit of\ngrace, until its voice is no longer heard, and they are left to the\ndelusions which they have chosen. \u00a0{PP 635.4}",

They felt little solicitude that their king should possess\nthose higher qualities which alone could fit him to rule with justice\nand equity. They did not ask for one who had true nobility of character,\nwho possessed the love and fear of God. They had not sought counsel from\nGod as to the qualities a ruler should possess, in order to preserve\ntheir distinctive, holy character as His chosen people. They were not\nseeking God's way, but their own way. Therefore God gave them such a\nking as they desired---one whose character was a reflection of their\nown. Their hearts were not in submission to God, and their king also was\nunsubdued by divine grace.

Then He called to the throne\n\"a man after His own heart\" (1 Samuel 13:14)---not one who was faultless\nin character, but who, instead of trusting to himself, would rely upon\nGod, and be guided by His Spirit; who, when he sinned, would submit to\nreproof and correction. \u00a0{PP 636.2}"

                "A few miles south of Jerusalem, \"the city of the great King,\" is\nBethlehem, where David, the son of Jesse, was born more than a thousand\nyears before the infant Jesus was cradled in the manger and worshiped by\nthe Wise Men from the East. Centuries before the advent of the Saviour,\nDavid, in the freshness of boyhood, kept watch of his flocks as they\ngrazed on the hills surrounding Bethlehem. The simple shepherd boy sang\nthe songs of his own composing, and the music of his harp made a sweet\naccompaniment to the melody of his fresh young voice. The Lord had\nchosen David, and was preparing him, in his solitary life with his\nflocks, for the work He designed to commit to his trust in after\nyears. \u00a0{PP 637.1}",
                "While David was thus living in the retirement of his humble shepherd's\nlife, the Lord God was speaking about him to the prophet Samuel. \"And\nthe Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I\nhave rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil,\nand go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided\nMe a king among his sons\\.... Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am\ncome to sacrifice to the Lord. And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I\nwill show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto Me him\nwhom I name unto thee. And Samuel did that which the Lord spake, and\ncame to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming,\nand said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.\" The elders\naccepted an invitation to the sacrifice, and Samuel called also Jesse\nand his sons. The altar was built and the sacrifice was ready. All the\nhousehold of Jesse were present, with the exception of David, the\nyoungest son, who had been left to guard the sheep, for it was not safe\nto leave the flocks unprotected. \u00a0{PP 637.2}",
                "When the sacrifice was ended, and before partaking of the offering\nfeast, Samuel began his prophetic inspection of the noble-appearing sons\nof Jesse. Eliab was the eldest, and more nearly resembled Saul for\nstature and beauty than the others. His comely features and finely\ndeveloped form attracted the attention of the prophet. As Samuel looked\nupon his princely bearing, he thought, \"This is indeed the man whom God\nhas chosen as successor to Saul,\" and he waited for the divine sanction\nthat he might anoint him. But Jehovah did not look upon the outward\nappearance. Eliab did not fear the Lord. Had he been called to the\nthrone, he would have been a proud, exacting ruler. The Lord's word to\nSamuel was, \"Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his\nstature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man\nseeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh\non the heart.\" No outward beauty can recommend the soul to God. The\nwisdom and excellence revealed in the character and deportment, express\nthe true beauty of the man; and it is the inner worth, the excellency of\nthe heart, that determines our acceptance with the Lord of hosts. How\ndeeply should we feel this truth in the judgment of ourselves and\nothers. We may learn from the mistake of Samuel how vain is the\nestimation that rests on beauty of face or nobility of stature. We may\nsee how incapable is man's wisdom of understanding the secrets of the\nheart or of comprehending the counsels of God without special\nenlightenment from heaven. The thoughts and ways of God in relation to\nHis creatures are above our finite minds; but we may be assured that His\nchildren will be brought to fill the very place for which they are\nqualified, and will be enabled to accomplish the very work committed to\ntheir hands, if they will but submit their will to God, that His\nbeneficent plans may not be frustrated by the perversity of man. \u00a0{PP\n638.1}",

With painful suspense Samuel had looked upon the last of the young\nmen; the prophet was perplexed and bewildered. He inquired of Jesse,\n\"Are here all thy children?\" The father answered, \"There remaineth yet\nthe youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep.\" Samuel directed that he\nshould be summoned, saying, \"We will not sit down till he come\nhither.\" \u00a0{PP 638.2}",

As humble and modest as before his\nanointing, the shepherd boy returned to the hills and watched and\nguarded his flocks as tenderly as ever. But with new inspiration he\ncomposed his melodies and played upon his harp. Before him spread a\nlandscape of rich and varied beauty. The vines, with their clustering\nfruit, brightened in the sunshine. The forest trees, with their green\nfoliage, swayed in the breeze. He beheld the sun flooding the heavens\nwith light, coming forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber and\nrejoicing as a strong man to run a race.

The light of day, gilding\nforest and mountain, meadow and stream, carried the mind up to behold\nthe Father of lights, the \u00a0Author of every good and perfect gift. Daily\nrevelations of the character and majesty of his Creator filled the young\npoet's heart with adoration and rejoicing. In contemplation of God and\nHis works the faculties of David's mind and heart were developing and\nstrengthening for the work of his afterlife. He was daily coming into a\nmore intimate communion with God. His mind was constantly penetrating\ninto new depths for fresh themes to inspire his song and to wake the\nmusic of his harp.

His opportunities of contemplation and meditation served to\nenrich him with that wisdom and piety that made him beloved of God and\nangels. As he contemplated the perfections of his Creator, clearer\nconceptions of God opened before his soul. Obscure themes were\nilluminated, difficulties were made plain, perplexities were harmonized,\nand each ray of new light called forth fresh bursts of rapture, and\nsweeter anthems of devotion, to the glory of God and the Redeemer. The\nlove that moved him, the sorrows that beset him, the triumphs that\nattended him, were all themes for his active thought; and as he beheld\nthe love of God in all the providences of his life, his heart throbbed\nwith more fervent adoration and gratitude, his voice rang out in a\nricher melody, his harp was swept with more exultant joy; and the\nshepherd boy proceeded from strength to strength, from knowledge to\nknowledge; for the Spirit of the Lord was upon him. \u00a0{PP 642.2}"

It\nwas not true repentance that had bowed the proud head of the king. He\nhad no clear perception of the offensive character of his sin, and did\nnot arouse to the work of reforming his life, but brooded over what he\nthought was the injustice of God in depriving him of the throne of\nIsrael and in taking the succession away from his posterity. He was ever\noccupied in anticipating the ruin that had been brought upon his house.\nHe felt that the valor which he had displayed in encountering his\nenemies should offset his sin of disobedience. He did not accept with\nmeekness the chastisement of God; but his haughty spirit became\ndesperate, until he was on the verge of losing his reason. His\ncounselors advised him to seek for the services of a skillful musician,\nin the hope that the soothing notes of a sweet instrument might calm his\ntroubled spirit. In the providence of God, David, as a skillful\nperformer upon the harp, was brought before the king. His lofty and\nheaven-inspired strains had the desired effect.

He\nhad discovered some of the temptations that beset the soul of Saul and\nhad penetrated some of the mysteries in the character and dealings of\nIsrael's first king.

All these things served to bring\ntroubled thoughts to him who had been anointed to be king over Israel.\nBut while he was absorbed in deep meditation, and harassed by thoughts\nof anxiety, he turned to his harp, and called forth strains that\nelevated his mind to the Author of every good, and the dark clouds that\nseemed to shadow the horizon of the future were dispelled. \u00a0{PP 643.3}",

In a secluded cave the son of Jesse and\nhis men waited for the guidance of God as to what should be done. As\nSaul was pressing his way up the mountains, he turned aside, and\nentered, alone, the very cavern in which David and his band were hidden.\nWhen David's men saw this they urged their leader to kill Saul. The fact\nthat the king was now in their power was interpreted by them as certain\nevidence that God Himself had delivered the enemy into their hand, that\nthey might destroy him.

Then\nhe addressed Saul in these words: \"Wherefore hearest thou men's words,\nsaying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? Behold, this day thine eyes have\nseen how that the Lord hath delivered thee today into mine hand in the\ncave: and some bade me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said,\nI will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the Lord's\nanointed.

David and his men might have helped themselves from\nthe flocks and herds, but they did not. They behaved themselves in an\nhonest way. Their kindness, however, was lost upon Nabal. The answer he\nreturned to David was indicative of his character: \"Who is David? and\nwho is the son of Jesse? There be many servants nowadays that break away\nevery man from his master.

Nabal had\nscornfully exclaimed, \"Who is David?\" but Abigail called him, \"my lord.\"\nWith kind words she sought to soothe his irritated feelings, and she\npleaded with him in behalf of her husband. With nothing of ostentation\nor pride, but full of the wisdom and love of God, Abigail revealed the\nstrength of her devotion to her household; and she made it plain to\nDavid that the unkind course of her husband was in no wise premeditated\nagainst him as a personal affront, but was simply the outburst of an\nunhappy and selfish nature. \u00a0{PP 666.1}",

The burial of\nAbner was attended with public honors. The army, with Joab at their\nhead, were required to take part in the services of mourning, with rent\ngarments and clothed in sackcloth. The king manifested his grief by\nkeeping a fast upon the day of burial; he followed the bier as chief\nmourner; and at the grave he pronounced an elegy which was a cutting\nrebuke of the murderers. \"The king lamented over Abner, and said: \u00a0{PP\n699.3}",

                "David's magnanimous recognition of one who had been his bitter enemy won\nthe confidence and admiration of all Israel. \"All the people took notice\nof it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the\npeople. For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it\nwas not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.\" In the private circle\nof his trusted counselors and attendants the king spoke of the crime,\nand recognizing his own inability to punish the murderers as he desired,\nhe left them to the justice of God: \"Know ye not that there is a prince\nand a great man fallen this day in Israel? And I am this day weak,\nthough anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for\nme: the Lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his\nwickedness.\" \u00a0{PP 700.2}",
                "Abner had been sincere in his offers and representations to David, yet\nhis motives were base and selfish. He had persistently opposed the king\nof God's appointment, in the expectation of securing honor to himself.\nIt was resentment, wounded pride, and passion that led him to forsake\nthe cause he had so long served; and in deserting to David he hoped to\nreceive the highest position of honor in his service. Had he succeeded\nin his purpose, his talents and ambition, his great influence and want\nof godliness, would have endangered the throne of David and the peace\nand prosperity of the nation. \u00a0{PP 700.3}",
                "\"When Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were\nfeeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.\" It was \u00a0evident that the\nkingdom could not long be maintained. Soon another act of treachery\ncompleted the downfall of the waning power. Ishbosheth was foully\nmurdered by two of his captains, who, cutting off his head, hastened\nwith it to the king of Judah, hoping thus to ingratiate themselves in\nhis favor. \u00a0{PP 700.4}",
                "They appeared before David with the gory witness to their crime, saying,\n\"Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought\nthy life; and the Lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul,\nand of his seed.\" But David, whose throne God Himself had established,\nand whom God had delivered from his adversaries, did not desire the aid\nof treachery to establish his power. He told these murderers of the doom\nvisited upon him who boasted of slaying Saul. \"How much more,\" he added,\n\"when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his\nbed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take\nyou away from the earth? And David commanded his young men, and they\nslew them\\.... But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the\nsepulchre of Abner in Hebron.\" \u00a0{PP 701.1}",
                "After the death of Ishbosheth there was a general desire among the\nleading men of Israel that David should become king of all the tribes.\n\"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake,\nsaying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.\" They declared, \"Thou\nwast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord said to\nthee, Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over\nIsrael. So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and King\nDavid made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord.\" Thus through\nthe providence of God the way had been opened for him to come to the\nthrone.

The very hills and\nvalleys were alive with the multitudes. The hour for the coronation was\nappointed; the man who had been expelled from the court of Saul, who had\nfled \u00a0to the mountains and hills and to the caves of the earth to\npreserve his life, was about to receive the highest honor that can be\nconferred upon man by his fellow man.

David was arrayed in the royal robe.\nThe sacred oil was put upon his brow by the high priest, for the\nanointing by Samuel had been prophetic of what would take place at the\ninauguration of the king. The time had come, and David, by solemn rite,\nwas consecrated to his office as God's vicegerent. The scepter was\nplaced in his hands. The covenant of his righteous sovereignty was\nwritten, and the people gave their pledges of loyalty. The diadem was\nplaced upon his brow, and the coronation ceremony was over.

David was\nastonished and greatly alarmed, and in his heart he questioned the\njustice of God. He had been seeking to honor the ark as the symbol of\nthe divine presence. Why, then, had that fearful judgment been sent to\nturn the season of gladness into an occasion of grief and mourning?\nFeeling that it would be unsafe to have the ark near him, David\ndetermined to let it remain where it was. A place was found for it\nnearby, at the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. \u00a0{PP 705.1}",
                "The fate of Uzzah was a divine judgment upon the violation of a most\nexplicit command. Through Moses the Lord had given special instruction\nconcerning the transportation of the ark. None but the priests, the\ndescendants of Aaron, were to touch it, or even to look upon it\nuncovered. The divine direction was, \"The sons of Kohath shall come to\nbear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they\ndie.\" \u00a0Numbers 4:15. The priests were to cover the ark, and then the\nKohathites must lift it by the staves, which were placed in rings upon\neach side of the ark and were never removed. To the Gershonites and\nMerarites, who had in charge the curtains and boards and pillars of the\ntabernacle, Moses gave carts and oxen for the transportation of that\nwhich was committed to them. \"But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none:\nbecause the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they\nshould bear \u00a0*upon their shoulders*.\" \u00a0Numbers 7:9.

The Philistines, who had not a knowledge of God's law, had\nplaced the ark upon a cart when they returned it to Israel, and the Lord\naccepted the effort which they made. But the Israelites had in their\nhands a plain statement of the will of God in all these matters, and\ntheir neglect of these instructions was dishonoring to God. Upon Uzzah\nrested the greater guilt of presumption. Transgression of God's law had\nlessened his sense of its sacredness, and with unconfessed sins upon him\nhe had, in face of the divine prohibition, presumed to touch the symbol\nof God's presence. God can accept no partial obedience, no lax way of\ntreating His commandments. By the judgment upon Uzzah He designed to\nimpress upon all Israel the importance of giving strict heed to His\nrequirements. Thus the death of that one man, by leading the people to\nrepentance, might prevent the necessity of inflicting judgments upon\nthousands. \u00a0{PP 705.3}",

After advancing\nsix paces the trumpet sounded a halt. By David's direction sacrifices of\n\"oxen and fatlings\" were to be offered. Rejoicing now took the place of\ntrembling and terror. The king had laid \u00a0aside his royal robes and had\nattired himself in a plain linen ephod, such as was worn by the priests.\nHe did not by this act signify that he assumed priestly functions, for\nthe ephod was sometimes worn by others besides the priests.

Amusements that have\na tendency to weaken the love for sacred things and lessen our joy in\nthe service of God are not to be sought by Christians. The music and\ndancing in joyful praise to God at the removal of the ark had not the\nfaintest resemblance to the dissipation of modern dancing.

Through reports from the enemies of David, Mephibosheth had been\nled to cherish a strong prejudice against him as a usurper; but the\nmonarch's generous and courteous reception of him and his continued\nkindness won the heart of the young man; he became strongly attached to\nDavid, and, like his father Jonathan, he felt that his interest was one\nwith that of the king whom God had chosen. \u00a0{PP 713.1}",

Since they owe all to God\nthe glory of whatever they are or do belongs to Him alone; they are but\ninstruments in His hands. More than this---as all the lessons of Bible\nhistory teach---it is a perilous thing to praise or exalt men; for if\none comes to lose sight of his entire dependence on God, and to trust to\nhis own strength, he is sure to fall. Man is contending with foes who\nare stronger than he. \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but\nagainst principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the\ndarkness of this world, against wicked spirits in high\nplaces.\" \u00a0Ephesians 6:12, margin.

According to the\ncustoms prevailing among Eastern rulers, crimes not to be tolerated in\nsubjects were uncondemned in the king; the monarch was not under\nobligation to exercise the same self-restraint as the subject. All this\ntended to lessen David's sense of the exceeding sinfulness of sin. And\ninstead of relying in humility upon the power of Jehovah, he began to\ntrust to his own wisdom and might. As soon as Satan can separate the\nsoul from \u00a0God, the only Source of strength, he will seek to arouse the\nunholy desires of man's carnal nature. The work of the enemy is not\nabrupt; it is not, at the outset, sudden and startling; it is a secret\nundermining of the strongholds of principle.

The law pronounced death upon the\nadulterer, and the unnatural crime of Amnon made him doubly guilty. But\nDavid, self-condemned for his own sin, failed to bring the offender to\njustice. For two full years Absalom, the natural protector of the sister\nso foully wronged, concealed his purpose of revenge, but only to strike\nmore surely at the last.

But David, with characteristic\nunselfishness, could not consent that these strangers who had sought his\nprotection should be involved in his calamity.

God, who dwelt between the\ncherubim, had said of Jerusalem, \"This is My rest\" (Psalm 132:14); and\nwithout divine authority neither priest nor king had a right to remove\ntherefrom the symbol of His presence.

And now in his hurried and sorrowful\nflight, his feet bare, his royal robes changed for sackcloth, the\nlamentations of his followers awaking the echoes of the hills, he\nthought of his loved capital---of the place which had been the scene of\nhis sin---and as he remembered the goodness and long-suffering of God,\nhe was not altogether without hope. He felt that the Lord would still\ndeal with him in mercy. \u00a0{PP 737.2}",

He had confessed his sin, and for years had sought\nto do his duty as a faithful servant of God; he had labored for the\nupbuilding of his kingdom, and under his rule it had attained to\nstrength and prosperity never reached before. He had gathered rich\nstores of material for the building of the house of God, and now was all\nthe labor of his life to be swept away? Must the results of years of\nconsecrated toil, the work of genius and devotion and statesmanship,\npass into the hands of his reckless and traitorous son, who regarded not\nthe honor of God nor the prosperity of \u00a0Israel?

And David's history enables\nus to see also the great ends which God has in view in His dealings with\nsin; it enables us to trace, even through darkest judgments, the working\nout of His purposes of mercy and beneficence. He caused David to pass\nunder the rod, but He did not destroy him; the furnace is to purify, but\nnot to consume.

Hushai\nwas among the first to greet the new-crowned monarch, and the prince was\nsurprised and gratified at the accession of his father's old friend and\ncounselor. Absalom was confident of success. Thus far his schemes had\nprospered, and eager to strengthen his throne and secure the confidence\nof the nation, he welcomed Hushai to his court. \u00a0{PP 738.3}",

A large part of the nation were still true to him; he was\nsurrounded by tried warriors, who were faithful to their king, and his\narmy was commanded by able and experienced generals. Ahithophel knew\nthat after the first burst of enthusiasm in favor of the new king, a\nreaction would come. Should the rebellion fail, Absalom might be able to\nsecure a reconciliation with his father; then Ahithophel, as his chief\ncounselor, would be held most guilty for the rebellion; upon him the\nheaviest punishment would fall. To prevent Absalom from retracing his\nsteps, Ahithophel counseled him to an act that in the eyes of the whole\nnation would make reconciliation impossible. With hellish cunning this\nwily and unprincipled statesman urged Absalom to add the crime of incest\nto that of rebellion. In the sight of all Israel he was to take to\nhimself his father's concubines, according to the custom of oriental\nnations, thus declaring that he succeeded to his father's throne. And\nAbsalom carried out the vile suggestion. Thus was fulfilled the word of\nGod to David by the prophet, \"Behold, I will raise up evil against thee\nout of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and\ngive them unto thy neighbor\\.... For thou didst it secretly: but I will\ndo this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.\" \u00a02 Samuel 12:11,\n12.

For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his\nmen, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a\nbear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war,\nand will not lodge with the people. Behold, he is hid now in some pit,\nor in some other place;\" he argued that, if Absalom's forces should\npursue David, they would not capture the king; and should they suffer a\nreverse, it would tend to dishearten them and work great harm to\nAbsalom's cause. \"For,\" he said, \"all Israel knoweth that thy father is\na mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.\" And he\nsuggested a plan attractive to a vain and selfish nature, fond of the\nshow of power: \"I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto\nthee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for\nmultitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. So shall we\ncome upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light\nupon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men\nthat are with him there shall not be left so much as one.

And he knew that whatever might be the fate of the prince, there\nwas no hope for the counselor who had instigated his greatest crimes.\nAhithophel had encouraged Absalom in rebellion; he had counseled him to\nthe most abominable wickedness, to the dishonor of his father; he had\nadvised the slaying of David and had planned its accomplishment; he had\ncut off the last possibility of his own reconciliation with the king;\nand now another was preferred before him, even by Absalom. Jealous,\nangry, and desperate, Ahithophel \"gat him home to his house, to his\ncity, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died.\"\nSuch was the result of the wisdom of one, who, with all his high\nendowments, did not make God his counselor.

David's early life as a shepherd, with\nits lessons of humility, of patient toil, and of tender care for his\nflocks; the communion with nature in the solitude of the hills,\ndeveloping his genius for music and poetry, and directing his thoughts\nto the Creator; the long discipline of his wilderness life, calling into\nexercise courage, fortitude, patience, and faith in God, had been\nappointed by the Lord as a preparation for the throne of Israel. David\nhad enjoyed precious experiences of the love of God, and had been richly\nendowed with His Spirit; in the history of Saul he had seen the utter\nworthlessness of mere human wisdom.

They cared rather for their standing among other nations.\nThis spirit could not fail to invite temptation. With a view to\nextending his conquests among foreign nations, David determined to\nincrease his army by requiring military service from all who were of\nproper age. To effect this, it became necessary to take a census of the\npopulation. It was pride and ambition that prompted this action of the\nking.

This would tend still further to foster\nthe already too great self-confidence of both king and people. The\nScripture says, \"Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to\nnumber Israel.\" The prosperity of Israel under David had been due to the\nblessing of God rather than to the ability of her king or the strength\nof her armies.

Though his mind retained\nits clearness and strength, feebleness and age, with their desire for\nseclusion, prevented a quick apprehension of what was passing in the\nkingdom, and again rebellion sprang up in the very shadow of the throne.\nAgain the fruit of David's parental indulgence was manifest. The one who\nnow aspired to the throne was Adonijah, \"a very goodly man\" in person\nand bearing, but unprincipled and reckless. In his youth he had been\nsubjected to but little restraint; for \"his father had not displeased\nhim at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so?\" He now rebelled\nagainst the authority of God, who had appointed Solomon to the throne.\nBoth by natural endowments and religious character Solomon was better\nqualified than his elder brother to become ruler of Israel; yet although\nthe choice of God had been clearly indicated, Adonijah did not fail to\nfind sympathizers.

They represented the state of affairs to the king, reminding\nhim of the divine direction that Solomon should succeed to the throne.\nDavid at once abdicated in favor of Solomon, who was immediately\nanointed and proclaimed king. The conspiracy was crushed. Its chief\nactors had incurred the penalty of death. Abiathar's life was spared,\nout of respect to his office and his former fidelity to David; but he\nwas degraded from the office of high priest, which passed to the line of\nZadok.

Because of his physical weakness, it had not been expected\nthat he would attend to this transfer in person; but the inspiration of\nGod came upon him, and with more than his wonted fervor and power, he\nwas able, for the last time, to address his people.

Seeing how entrenched sun worship was\nin the religious life of the Egyptians, and how highly the sun god Ra,\nAmen-Ra, or Aton was revered, we can understand why the plague directed\nagainst the god was brought upon Egypt toward the culmination of the\nfight between the God of the Hebrews and His Egyptian adversaries. \u00a0{PP\n758.4}",

In the days of Samuel the\npeople asked that they might have a king. This was allowed, and God\nchose Saul, and Samuel anointed him king of Israel. Saul failed to do\nthe will of God; and as he rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord\nrejected him from being king and sent Samuel to anoint David king of\nIsrael; and David's throne God established forevermore.
