This\nlonging is implanted in the very constitution of man by a merciful God,\nthat man may not be satisfied with his present conditions or\nattainments, whether bad, or good, or better. God desires that the human\nshall seek the best, and find it to the eternal blessing of his\nsoul. \u00a0{DA 17.1}",
                "Satan, by wily scheme and craft, has perverted these longings of the\nhuman heart. He makes men believe that this desire may be satisfied by\npleasure, by wealth, by ease, by fame, by power; but those who have been\nthus deceived by him (and they number myriads) find all these things\npall upon the sense, leaving the soul as barren and unsatisfied as\nbefore. \u00a0{DA 17.2}",
                "It is God's design that this longing of the human heart should lead to\nthe one who alone is able to satisfy it. The desire is \u00a0*of* \u00a0Him that it\nmay lead \u00a0*to* \u00a0Him, the fullness and fulfillment of that desire. That\nfullness is found in Jesus the Christ, the Son of the Eternal God. \"For\nit was the good pleasure of the Father that in Him should all the\nfullness dwell;\" \"For in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead\nbodily.\" And it is also true that \"In Him ye are made full\" with respect\nto every desire divinely implanted and normally followed. \u00a0{DA 17.3}",

                "It is not, however, the purpose of this work to set forth a harmony of\nthe gospels, or even to give in strictly chronological order the\nimportant events and wonderful lessons of the life of Christ; its\npurpose is to present the love of God as revealed in his Son, the divine\nbeauty of the life of Christ, of which all may partake, and not to\nsatisfy the desires of the merely curious nor the questionings of\ncritics. But even as by the attraction of His own goodness of character\nJesus drew His disciples unto Himself, and by His personal presence, by\nHis sympathetic touch and feeling in all their infirmities and needs,\nand by His constant association, transformed their characters from the\nearthly to the heavenly, from the selfish to the sacrificing, from\nsmallhearted ignorance and prejudice to largehearted knowledge and\nprofound love for souls of all nations and races, even so it is the\npurpose of this book so to present the blessed Redeemer as to help the\nreader to come to Him face to face, heart to heart, and find in Him,\neven as did the disciples of old, Jesus the Mighty One, who saves \"to\nthe uttermost,\" and transforms to His own divine image all those who\ncome unto God by Him.

To this sin-darkened earth He came to reveal the light of\nGod's love,---to be \"God with us.\" Therefore it was prophesied of Him,\n\"His name shall be called Immanuel.\" \u00a0{DA 19.1}",
                "By coming to dwell with us, Jesus was to reveal God both to men and to\nangels. He was the Word of God,---God's thought made audible. In His\nprayer for His disciples He says, \"I have declared unto them Thy\nname,\"---\"merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in\ngoodness and truth,\"---\"that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may\nbe in them, and I in them.\" But not alone for His earthborn children was\nthis revelation given. Our little world is the lesson book of the\nuniverse. God's wonderful purpose of grace, the mystery of redeeming\nlove, is the theme into which \"angels desire to look,\" and it will be\ntheir study throughout endless ages. Both the redeemed \u00a0and the unfallen\nbeings will find in the cross of Christ their science and their song. It\nwill be seen that the glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of\nself-sacrificing love. In the light from Calvary it will be seen that\nthe law of self-renouncing love is the law of life for earth and heaven;\nthat the love which \"seeketh not her own\" has its source in the heart of\nGod; and that in the meek and lowly One is manifested the character of\nHim who dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto. \u00a0{DA 19.2}",
                "In the beginning, God was revealed in all the works of creation. It was\nChrist that spread the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth.\nIt was His hand that hung the worlds in space, and fashioned the flowers\nof the field. \"His strength setteth fast the mountains.\" \"The sea is\nHis, and He made it.\" \u00a0Psalm 65:6; \u00a095:5. It was He that filled the earth\nwith beauty, and the air with song. And upon all things in earth, and\nair, and sky, He wrote the message of the Father's love. \u00a0{DA 20.1}",
                "Now sin has marred God's perfect work, yet that handwriting remains.\nEven now all created things declare the glory of His excellence. There\nis nothing, save the selfish heart of man, that lives unto itself. No\nbird that cleaves the air, no animal that moves upon the ground, but\nministers to some other life. There is no leaf of the forest, or lowly\nblade of grass, but has its ministry. Every tree and shrub and leaf\npours forth that element of life without which neither man nor animal\ncould live; and man and animal, in turn, minister to the life of tree\nand shrub and leaf. The flowers breathe fragrance and unfold their\nbeauty in blessing \u00a0to the world. The sun sheds its light to gladden a\nthousand worlds.

Heavenly beings woo the\nhearts of men; they bring to this dark world light from the courts\nabove; by gentle and patient ministry they move upon the human spirit,\nto bring the lost into a fellowship with Christ which is even closer\nthan they themselves can know. \u00a0{DA 21.1}",
                "But turning from all lesser representations, we behold God in Jesus.\nLooking unto Jesus we see that it is the glory of our God to give. \"I do\nnothing of Myself,\" said Christ; \"the living Father hath sent Me, and I\nlive by the Father.\" \"I seek not Mine own glory,\" but the glory of Him\nthat sent Me. \u00a0John 8:28; \u00a06:57; \u00a08:50; \u00a07:18. In these words is set forth\nthe great principle which is the law of life for the universe. All\nthings Christ received from God, but He took to give. So in the heavenly\ncourts, in His ministry for all created beings: through the beloved Son,\nthe Father's life flows out to all; through the Son it returns, in\npraise and joyous service, a tide of love, to the great Source of all.\nAnd thus through Christ the circuit of beneficence is complete,\nrepresenting the character of the great Giver, the law of life. \u00a0{DA\n21.2}",
                "In heaven itself this law was broken. Sin originated in self-seeking.\nLucifer, the covering cherub, desired to be first in heaven. He sought\nto gain control of heavenly beings, to draw them away from their\nCreator, and to win their homage to himself. Therefore he misrepresented\nGod, \u00a0attributing to Him the desire for self-exaltation. With his own\nevil characteristics he sought to invest the loving Creator. Thus he\ndeceived angels. Thus he deceived men. He led them to doubt the word of\nGod, and to distrust His goodness. Because God is a God of justice and\nterrible majesty, Satan caused them to look upon Him as severe and\nunforgiving. Thus he drew men to join him in rebellion against God, and\nthe night of woe settled down upon the world. \u00a0{DA 21.3}",
                "The earth was dark through misapprehension of God. That the gloomy\nshadows might be lightened, that the world might be brought back to God,\nSatan's deceptive power was to be broken. This could not be done by\nforce. The exercise of force is contrary to the principles of God's\ngovernment; He desires only the service of love; and love cannot be\ncommanded; it cannot be won by force or authority. Only by love is love\nawakened. To know God is to love Him; His character must be manifested\nin contrast to the character of Satan. This work only one Being in all\nthe universe could do. Only He who knew the height and depth of the love\nof God could make it known. Upon the world's dark night the Sun of\nRighteousness must rise, \"with healing in His wings.\" \u00a0Malachi 4:2. \u00a0{DA\n22.1}",
                "The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan formulated\nafter the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of \"the mystery which hath\nbeen kept in silence through times eternal.\" \u00a0Romans 16:25, R. V. It was\nan unfolding of the principles that from eternal ages have been the\nfoundation of God's throne. From the beginning, God and Christ knew of\nthe apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man through the deceptive\npower of the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He\nforesaw its existence, and made provision to meet the terrible\nemergency. So great was His love for the world, that He covenanted to\ngive His only-begotten Son, \"that whosoever believeth in Him should not\nperish, but have everlasting life.\" \u00a0John 3:16. \u00a0{DA 22.2}",
                "Lucifer had said, \"I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; \\... I\nwill be like the Most High.\" \u00a0Isaiah 14:13, 14.

V., margin. \u00a0{DA 22.3}",
                "This was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have remained at the\nFather's side. He might have retained the glory of heaven, and the\nhomage of the angels. But He chose to give back the scepter into \u00a0the\nFather's hands, and to step down from the throne of the universe, that\nHe might bring light to the benighted, and life to the perishing. \u00a0{DA\n22.4}",
                "Nearly two thousand years ago, a voice of mysterious import was heard in\nheaven, from the throne of God, \"Lo, I come.\" \"Sacrifice and offering\nThou wouldest not, but a body hast Thou prepared Me\\.... Lo, I come (in\nthe volume of the Book it is written of Me,) to do Thy will, O\nGod.\" \u00a0Hebrews 10:5-7. In these words is announced the fulfillment of the\npurpose that had been hidden from eternal ages. Christ was about to\nvisit our world, and to become incarnate. He says, \"A body hast Thou\nprepared Me.\" Had He appeared with the glory that was His with the\nFather before the world was, we could not have endured the light of His\npresence. That we might behold it and not be destroyed, the\nmanifestation of His glory was shrouded. His divinity was veiled with\nhumanity,---the invisible glory in the visible human form. \u00a0{DA 23.1}",
                "This great purpose had been shadowed forth in types and symbols. The\nburning bush, in which Christ appeared to Moses, revealed God. The\nsymbol chosen for the representation of the Deity was a lowly shrub,\nthat seemingly had no attractions. This enshrined the Infinite. The\nall-merciful God shrouded His glory in a most humble type, that Moses\ncould look upon it and live. So in the pillar of cloud by day and the\npillar of fire by night, God communicated with Israel, revealing to men\nHis will, and imparting to them His grace. God's glory was subdued, and\nHis majesty veiled, that the weak vision of finite men might behold it.\nSo Christ was to come in \"the body of our humiliation\" (Philippians\n3:21, R. V.), \"in the likeness of men.\" In the eyes of the world He\npossessed no beauty that they should desire Him; yet He was the\nincarnate God, the light of heaven and earth. His glory was veiled, His\ngreatness and majesty were hidden, that He might draw near to sorrowful,\ntempted men. \u00a0{DA 23.2}",
                "God commanded Moses for Israel, \"Let them make Me a sanctuary; that I\nmay dwell among them\" (Exodus 25:8), and He abode in the sanctuary, in\nthe midst of His people. Through all their weary wandering in the\ndesert, the symbol of His presence was with them. So Christ set up His\ntabernacle in the midst of our human encampment. He pitched His tent by\nthe side of the tents of men, that He might dwell among us, and make us\nfamiliar with His divine character and life. \"The Word became flesh, and\ntabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of \u00a0the Only\nBegotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.\" \u00a0John 1:14, R. V.,\nmargin. \u00a0{DA 23.3}",
                "Since Jesus came to dwell with us, we know that God is acquainted with\nour trials, and sympathizes with our griefs. Every son and daughter of\nAdam may understand that our Creator is the friend of sinners. For in\nevery doctrine of grace, every promise of joy, every deed of love, every\ndivine attraction presented in the Saviour's life on earth, we see \"God\nwith us.\" \u00a0{DA 24.1}",
                "Satan represents God's law of love as a law of selfishness. He declares\nthat it is impossible for us to obey its precepts. The fall of our first\nparents, with all the woe that has resulted, he charges upon the\nCreator, leading men to look upon God as the author of sin, and\nsuffering, and death. Jesus was to unveil this deception. As one of us\nHe was to give an example of obedience. For this He took upon Himself\nour nature, and passed through our experiences. \"In all things it\nbehooved Him to be made like unto His brethren.\" \u00a0Hebrews 2:17. If we had\nto bear anything which Jesus did not endure, then upon this point Satan\nwould represent the power of God as insufficient for us. Therefore Jesus\nwas \"in all points tempted like as we are.\" \u00a0Hebrews 4:15. He endured\nevery trial to which we are subject. And He exercised in His own behalf\nno power that is not freely offered to us. As man, He met temptation,\nand overcame in the strength given Him from God. He says, \"I delight to\ndo Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\" \u00a0Psalm 40:8. As\nHe went about doing good, and healing all who were afflicted by Satan,\nHe made plain to men the character of God's law and the nature of His\nservice. His life testifies that it is possible for us also to obey the\nlaw of God. \u00a0{DA 24.2}",
                "By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold\nupon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave us an example of\nobedience; as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey. It was Christ\nwho from the bush on Mount Horeb spoke to Moses saying, \"I AM THAT I\nAM\\.... Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent\nme unto you.\" \u00a0Exodus 3:14. This was the pledge of Israel's deliverance.\nSo when He came \"in the likeness of men,\" He declared Himself the I AM.\nThe Child of Bethlehem, the meek and lowly Saviour, is God \"manifest in\nthe flesh.\" \u00a01 Timothy 3:16. And to us He says: \"I AM the Good Shepherd.\"\n\"I AM the living Bread.\" \"I AM the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\" \"All\npower is given \u00a0unto Me in heaven and in earth.\" \u00a0John\n10:11; \u00a06:51; \u00a014:6; \u00a0Matthew 28:18.

                "In stooping to take upon Himself humanity, Christ revealed a character\nthe opposite of the character of Satan. But He stepped still lower in\nthe path of humiliation. \"Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled\nHimself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the\ncross.\" \u00a0Philippians 2:8. As the high priest laid aside his gorgeous\npontifical robes, and officiated in the white linen dress of the common\npriest, so Christ took the form of a servant, and offered sacrifice,\nHimself the priest, Himself the victim. \"He was wounded for our\ntransgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of\nour peace was upon Him.\" \u00a0Isaiah 53:5. \u00a0{DA 25.1}",

In taking our nature,\nthe Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be\nbroken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us. \"God so loved the\nworld, that He gave His only-begotten Son.\" \u00a0John 3:16. He gave Him not\nonly to bear our sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the\nfallen race.

Under the synagogue teachers the\nyouth were instructed in the countless regulations which as orthodox\nIsraelites they were expected to observe. But Jesus did not interest\nHimself in these matters. From childhood He acted independently of the\nrabbinical laws. The Scriptures of the Old Testament were His constant\nstudy, and the words, \"Thus saith the Lord,\" were ever upon His\nlips. \u00a0{DA 84.1}",

Their service was a mere round of ceremonies;\nthe sacred truths it was designed to teach were hidden from the\nworshipers. He saw that in their faithless services they found no peace.\nThey did not know the freedom of spirit that would come to them by\nserving God in truth. Jesus had come to teach the meaning of the worship\nof God, and He could not sanction the mingling of human requirements\nwith the divine precepts. He did not attack the precepts or \u00a0practices of\nthe learned teachers; but when reproved for His own simple habits, He\npresented the word of God in justification of His conduct. \u00a0{DA 84.2}",

He would hear every word that proceeds from the\nmouth of God; but He could not obey the inventions of men. Jesus seemed\nto know the Scriptures from beginning to end, and He presented them in\ntheir true import.

In His contact with men He did not ask, What is your creed?\nTo what church do you belong? He exercised His helping power in behalf\nof all who needed help. Instead of secluding Himself in a hermit's cell\nin order to show His heavenly character, He labored earnestly for\nhumanity. He inculcated the principle that Bible religion does not\nconsist in the mortification of the body. He taught that pure and\nundefiled religion is not meant only for set times and special\noccasions. At all times and in all places He manifested a loving\ninterest in men, and shed about Him the light of a cheerful piety. All\nthis was a rebuke to the Pharisees.

To sin, wherever found, \"our God is a\nconsuming fire.\" \u00a0Hebrews 12:29. In all who submit to His power the\nSpirit of God will consume sin. But if men cling to sin, they become\nidentified with it. Then the glory of God, which destroys sin, must\ndestroy them. Jacob, after his night of wrestling with the Angel,\nexclaimed, \"I have seen God face to face, and my life is\npreserved.\" \u00a0Genesis 32:30. \u00a0Jacob had been guilty of a great sin in his\nconduct toward Esau; but he had repented. His transgression had been\nforgiven, and his sin purged; therefore he could endure the revelation\nof God's presence. But wherever men came before God while willfully\ncherishing evil, they were destroyed. At the second advent of Christ the\nwicked shall be consumed \"with the Spirit of His mouth,\" and destroyed\n\"with the brightness of His coming.\" \u00a02 Thessalonians 2:8. The light of\nthe glory of God, which imparts life to the righteous, will slay the\nwicked. \u00a0{DA 107.4}",

The fact that Jesus had for so many years remained in\nobscurity, giving no special evidence of His mission, gave occasion\nfor \u00a0doubt as to whether He could be the Promised One. The Baptist,\nhowever, waited in faith, believing that in God's own time all would be\nmade plain. It had been revealed to him that the Messiah would seek\nbaptism at his hands, and that a sign of His divine character should\nthen be given.

Among the\nmultitudes that had gathered about him at the Jordan, John had heard\ndark tales of crime, and had met souls bowed down with the burden of\nmyriad sins; but never had he come in contact with a human being from\nwhom there breathed an influence so divine. All this was in harmony with\nwhat had been revealed to John regarding the Messiah. Yet he shrank from\ngranting the request of Jesus. How could he, a sinner, baptize the\nSinless One?

In these ceremonies he discerned a symbol of\ncommunion between earth and heaven. He set himself to intercept this\ncommunion.

Would He leave Him\nin the desert with wild beasts, without food, without companions,\nwithout comfort?

When strength failed, and the will\npower weakened, and faith ceased to repose in God, then those who had\nstood long and valiantly for the right were overcome. Moses was wearied\nwith the forty years' wandering of Israel, when for the moment his faith\nlet go its hold upon infinite power. He failed just upon the borders of\nthe Promised Land. So with Elijah, who had stood undaunted before King\nAhab, who had faced the whole nation of Israel, with the four hundred\nand fifty prophets of Baal at their head. After that terrible day upon\nCarmel, when the false prophets had been slain, and the people had\ndeclared their allegiance to God, Elijah fled for his life before the\nthreats of the idolatrous Jezebel. Thus Satan has taken advantage of the\nweakness of humanity. And he will still work in the same way. Whenever\none is encompassed with clouds, perplexed by circumstances, or afflicted\nby poverty or distress, Satan is at hand to tempt and annoy. He attacks\nour weak points of character. He seeks to shake our confidence in God,\nwho suffers such a condition of things to exist. We are tempted to\ndistrust God, to question His love. Often the tempter comes to us as he\ncame to Christ, arraying before us our \u00a0weakness and infirmities. He\nhopes to discourage the soul, and to break our hold on God. Then he is\nsure of his prey. If we would meet him as Jesus did, we should escape\nmany a defeat. By parleying with the enemy, we give him an\nadvantage. \u00a0{DA 120.2}",
                "When Christ said to the tempter, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but\nby every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,\" He repeated the\nwords that, more than fourteen hundred years before, He had spoken to\nIsrael: \"The Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the\nwilderness\\.... And He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and\nfed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers\nknow; that He might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only,\nbut by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man\nlive.\" \u00a0Deuteronomy 8:2, 3. In the wilderness, when all means of\nsustenance failed, God sent His people manna from heaven; and a\nsufficient and constant supply was given. This provision was to teach\nthem that while they trusted in God and walked in His ways He would not\nforsake them. The Saviour now practiced the lesson He had taught to\nIsrael. By the word of God succor had been given to the Hebrew host, and\nby the same word it would be given to Jesus. He awaited God's time to\nbring relief. He was in the wilderness in obedience to God, and He would\nnot obtain food by following the suggestions of Satan. In the presence\nof the witnessing universe, He testified that it is a less calamity to\nsuffer whatever may befall than to depart in any manner from the will of\nGod. \u00a0{DA 121.1}",
                "\"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.\" Often the\nfollower of Christ is brought where he cannot serve God and carry\nforward his worldly enterprises. Perhaps it appears that obedience to\nsome plain requirement of God will cut off his means of support. Satan\nwould make him believe that he must sacrifice his conscientious\nconvictions. But the only thing in our world upon which we can rely is\nthe word of God. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His\nrighteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" \u00a0Matthew\n6:33. Even in this life it is not for our good to depart from the will\nof our Father in heaven. When we learn the power of His word, we shall\nnot follow the suggestions of Satan in order to obtain food or to save\nour lives. Our only questions will be, What is God's command? and what\nHis promise? Knowing these, we shall obey the one, and trust the\nother. \u00a0{DA 121.2}",
                "In the last great conflict of the controversy with Satan those who are\nloyal to God will see every earthly support cut off. Because they\nrefuse \u00a0to break His law in obedience to earthly powers, they will be\nforbidden to buy or sell. It will finally be decreed that they shall be\nput to death. See \u00a0Revelation 13:11-17. But to the obedient is given the\npromise, \"He shall dwell on high: his place of defense shall be the\nmunitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be\nsure.\" \u00a0Isaiah 33:16. By this promise the children of God will live. When\nthe earth shall be wasted with famine, they shall be fed. \"They shall\nnot be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be\nsatisfied.\" \u00a0Psalm 37:19. To that time of distress the prophet Habakkuk\nlooked forward, and his words express the faith of the church: \"Although\nthe fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the\nlabor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the\nflock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the\nstalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my\nsalvation.\" \u00a0Habakkuk 3:17, 18. \u00a0{DA 121.3}",
                "Of all the lessons to be learned from our Lord's first great temptation\nnone is more important than that bearing upon the control of the\nappetites and passions. In all ages, temptations appealing to the\nphysical nature have been most effectual in corrupting and degrading\nmankind. Through intemperance, Satan works to destroy the mental and\nmoral powers that God gave to man as a priceless endowment. Thus it\nbecomes impossible for men to appreciate things of eternal worth.\nThrough sensual indulgence, Satan seeks to blot from the soul every\ntrace of likeness to God. \u00a0{DA 122.1}",
                "The uncontrolled indulgence and consequent disease and degradation that\nexisted at Christ's first advent will again exist, with intensity of\nevil, before His second coming. Christ declares that the condition of\nthe world will be as in the days before the Flood, and as in Sodom and\nGomorrah. Every imagination of the thoughts of the heart will be evil\ncontinually. Upon the very verge of that fearful time we are now living,\nand to us should come home the lesson of the Saviour's fast. Only by the\ninexpressible anguish which Christ endured can we estimate the evil of\nunrestrained indulgence. His example declares that our only hope of\neternal life is through bringing the appetites and passions into\nsubjection to the will of God. \u00a0{DA 122.2}",
                "In our own strength it is impossible for us to deny the clamors of our\nfallen nature. Through this channel Satan will bring temptation upon us.\nChrist knew that the enemy would come to every human being, to take\nadvantage of hereditary weakness, and by his false insinuations to\nensnare all whose trust is not in God. And by passing over the ground\nwhich \u00a0man must travel, our Lord has prepared the way for us to overcome.\nIt is not His will that we should be placed at a disadvantage in the\nconflict with Satan. He would not have us intimidated and discouraged by\nthe assaults of the serpent. \"Be of good cheer,\" He says; \"I have\novercome the world.\" \u00a0John 16:33. \u00a0{DA 122.3}",

He\ndeclares, \"The Lord God will help Me; therefore shall I not be\nconfounded: \\... and I know that I shall not be ashamed\\.... Behold, the\nLord God will help Me.\" Pointing to His own example, He says to us, \"Who\nis among you that feareth the Lord, \\... that walketh in darkness, and\nhath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his\nGod.\" \u00a0Isaiah 50:7-10. \u00a0{DA 123.2}",
                "\"The prince of this world cometh,\" said Jesus, \"and hath nothing in\nMe.\" \u00a0John 14:30. There was in Him nothing that responded to Satan's\nsophistry. He did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did He yield\nto temptation. So it may be with us. Christ's humanity was united with\ndivinity; He was fitted for the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy\nSpirit. And He came to make us partakers of the divine nature. So long\nas we are united to Him by faith, sin has no more dominion over us. God\nreaches for the hand of faith in us to direct it to lay fast hold upon\nthe divinity of Christ, that we may attain to perfection of\ncharacter. \u00a0{DA 123.3}",

Faith would have led our first\nparents to trust the love of God, and to obey His commands. Presumption\nled them to transgress His law, believing that His great love would save\nthem from the consequence of their sin.

Yet she would have been\nmore than human if there had not mingled with this holy joy a trace of\nthe fond mother's natural pride. As she saw the many glances bent upon\nJesus, she longed to have Him prove to the company that He was really\nthe Honored of God. She hoped there might be opportunity for Him to work\na miracle before them. \u00a0{DA 145.3}",
                "It was the custom of the times for marriage festivities to continue\nseveral days. On this occasion, before the feast ended it was found that\nthe supply of wine had failed. This discovery caused much perplexity and\nregret. It was unusual to dispense with wine on festive occasions,\nand \u00a0its absence would seem to indicate a want of hospitality. As a\nrelative of the parties, Mary had assisted in the arrangements for the\nfeast, and she now spoke to Jesus, saying, \"They have no wine.\" These\nwords were a suggestion that He might supply their need. But Jesus\nanswered, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet\ncome.\" \u00a0{DA 145.4}",
                "This answer, abrupt as it seems to us, expressed no coldness or\ndiscourtesy. The Saviour's form of address to His mother was in\naccordance with Oriental custom. It was used toward persons to whom it\nwas desired to show respect. Every act of Christ's earthly life was in\nharmony with the precept He Himself had given, \"Honor thy father and thy\nmother.\" \u00a0Exodus 20:12. On the cross, in His last act of tenderness\ntoward His mother, Jesus again addressed her in the same way, as He\ncommitted her to the care of His best-loved disciple. Both at the\nmarriage feast and upon the cross, the love expressed in tone and look\nand manner interpreted His words. \u00a0{DA 146.1}",
                "At His visit to the temple in His boyhood, as the mystery of His\nlifework opened before Him, Christ had said to Mary, \"Wist ye not that I\nmust be about My Father's business?\" \u00a0Luke 2:49. These words \u00a0struck the\nkeynote of His whole life and ministry. Everything was held in abeyance\nto His work, the great work of redemption which He had come into the\nworld to accomplish. Now He repeated the lesson. There was danger that\nMary would regard her relationship to Jesus as giving her a special\nclaim upon Him, and the right, in some degree, to direct Him in His\nmission. For thirty years He had been to her a loving and obedient son,\nand His love was unchanged; but He must now go about His Father's work.\nAs Son of the Most High, and Saviour of the world, no earthly ties must\nhold Him from His mission, or influence His conduct. He must stand free\nto do the will of God. This lesson is also for us. The claims of God are\nparamount even to the ties of human relationship. No earthly attraction\nshould turn our feet from the path in which He bids us walk. \u00a0{DA 146.2}",
                "The only hope of redemption for our fallen race is in Christ; Mary could\nfind salvation only through the Lamb of God. In herself she possessed no\nmerit. Her connection with Jesus placed her in no different spiritual\nrelation to Him from that of any other human soul. This is indicated in\nthe Saviour's words. He makes clear the distinction between His relation\nto her as the Son of man and as the Son of God. The tie of kinship\nbetween them in no way placed her on an equality with Him. \u00a0{DA 147.1}",
                "The words, \"Mine hour is not yet come,\" point to the fact that every act\nof Christ's life on earth was in fulfillment of the plan that had\nexisted from the days of eternity. Before He came to earth, the plan lay\nout before Him, perfect in all its details. But as He walked among men,\nHe was guided, step by step, by the Father's will. He did not hesitate\nto act at the appointed time. With the same submission He waited until\nthe time had come. \u00a0{DA 147.2}",
                "In saying to Mary that His hour had not yet come, Jesus was replying to\nher unspoken thought,---to the expectation she cherished in common with\nher people. She hoped that He would reveal Himself as the Messiah, and\ntake the throne of Israel. But the time had not come. Not as a King, but\nas \"a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief,\" had Jesus accepted the\nlot of humanity. \u00a0{DA 147.3}",
                "But though Mary had not a right conception of Christ's mission, she\ntrusted Him implicitly. To this faith Jesus responded. It was to honor\nMary's trust, and to strengthen the faith of His disciples, that the\nfirst miracle was performed. The disciples were to encounter many and\ngreat temptations to unbelief. To them the prophecies had made it \u00a0clear\nbeyond all controversy that Jesus was the Messiah. They looked for the\nreligious leaders to receive Him with confidence even greater than their\nown. They declared among the people the wonderful works of Christ and\ntheir own confidence in His mission, but they were amazed and bitterly\ndisappointed by the unbelief, the deep-seated prejudice, and the enmity\nto Jesus, displayed by the priests and rabbis. The Saviour's early\nmiracles strengthened the disciples to stand against this\nopposition. \u00a0{DA 147.4}",

Then as the wine was wanted\nfor immediate use, He said, \"Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of\nthe feast.\" Instead of the water with which the vessels had been filled,\nthere flowed forth wine. Neither the ruler of the feast nor the guests\ngenerally were aware that the supply of wine had failed. Upon tasting\nthat which the servants brought, the ruler found it superior to any he\nhad ever before drunk, and very different from that served at the\nbeginning of the feast. Turning to the bridegroom, he said, \"Every man\nat the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk,\nthen that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until\nnow.\" \u00a0{DA 148.2}",

That which it offers may please\nthe eye and fascinate the senses, but it proves to be unsatisfying. The\nwine turns to bitterness, the gaiety to gloom. That which was begun with\nsongs and mirth ends in weariness and disgust. But the gifts of Jesus\nare ever fresh and new. The feast that He provides for the soul never\nfails to give satisfaction and joy. Each new gift increases the capacity\nof the receiver to appreciate and enjoy the blessings of the Lord. He\ngives grace for grace. There can be no failure of supply. If you abide\nin Him, the fact that you receive a rich gift today insures the\nreception of a richer gift tomorrow. The words of Jesus to Nathanael\nexpress the law of God's dealing with the children of faith. With every\nfresh revelation of His love, He declares to the receptive heart,\n\"Believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.\" \u00a0John\n1:50. \u00a0{DA 148.3}",
                "The gift of Christ to the marriage feast was a symbol. The water\nrepresented baptism into His death; the wine, the shedding of His\nblood \u00a0for the sins of the world. The water to fill the jars was brought\nby human hands, but the word of Christ alone could impart to it\nlife-giving virtue. So with the rites which point to the Saviour's\ndeath.

                "At the first feast He attended with His disciples, Jesus gave them the\ncup that symbolized His work for their salvation. At the last supper He\ngave it again, in the institution of that sacred rite by which His death\nwas to be shown forth \"till He come.\" \u00a01 Corinthians 11:26.

And He Himself provided no such beverage.\nSatan tempts men to indulgence that will becloud reason and benumb the\nspiritual perceptions, but Christ teaches us to bring the lower nature\ninto subjection. His whole life was an example of self-denial. In order\nto break the power of appetite, He suffered in our behalf the severest\ntest that humanity could endure. It was Christ who directed that John\nthe Baptist should drink neither wine nor strong drink. It was He who\nenjoined similar abstinence upon the wife of Manoah. And He pronounced a\ncurse upon the man who should put the bottle to his neighbor's lips.\nChrist did not contradict His own teaching. The unfermented wine which\nHe provided for the wedding guests was a wholesome and refreshing drink.\nIts effect was to bring the taste into harmony with a healthful\nappetite. \u00a0{DA 149.4}",

The news of the miracle spread through all that region,\nand was carried to Jerusalem. With new interest the priests and elders\nsearched the prophecies pointing to Christ's coming. There was eager\ndesire to learn the mission of this new teacher, who appeared among the\npeople in so unassuming a manner. \u00a0{DA 150.1}",
                "The ministry of Christ was in marked contrast to that of the Jewish\nelders. Their regard for tradition and formalism had destroyed all real\nfreedom of thought or action. They lived in continual dread of\ndefilement. To avoid contact with the \"unclean,\" they kept aloof, not\nonly from the Gentiles, but from the majority of their own people,\nseeking neither to benefit them nor to win their friendship. By dwelling\nconstantly on these matters, they had dwarfed their minds and narrowed\nthe orbit of their lives. Their example encouraged egotism and\nintolerance among all classes of the people. \u00a0{DA 150.2}",

While He showed the greatest reverence for the law of God, He\nrebuked the pretentious piety of the Pharisees, and tried to free the\npeople from the senseless rules that bound them. He was seeking to break\ndown the barriers which separated the different classes of society, that\nHe might bring men together as children of one family. His attendance at\nthe marriage feast was designed to be a step toward effecting this. \u00a0{DA\n150.3}",

                "Jesus reproved self-indulgence in all its forms, yet He was social in\nHis nature. He accepted the hospitality of all classes, visiting the\nhomes \u00a0of the rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, and\nseeking to elevate their thoughts from questions of commonplace life to\nthose things that are spiritual and eternal. He gave no license to\ndissipation, and no shadow of worldly levity marred His conduct; yet He\nfound pleasure in scenes of innocent happiness, and by His presence\nsanctioned the social gathering. A Jewish marriage was an impressive\noccasion, and its joy was not displeasing to the Son of man. By\nattending this feast, Jesus honored marriage as a divine\ninstitution. \u00a0{DA 150.5}",
                "In both the Old and the New Testament, the marriage relation is employed\nto represent the tender and sacred union that exists between Christ and\nHis people. To the mind of Jesus the gladness of the wedding festivities\npointed forward to the rejoicing of that day when He shall bring home\nHis bride to the Father's house, and the redeemed with the Redeemer\nshall sit down to the marriage supper of the Lamb. He says, \"As the\nbridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over\nthee.\" \"Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; \\... but thou shalt be\ncalled My Delight; \\... for the Lord delighteth in thee.\" \"He will\nrejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in His love, He will joy over\nthee with singing.\" \u00a0Isaiah 62:5, 4, margin; \u00a0Zephaniah 3:17.

He met them at their daily vocations, and\nmanifested an interest in their secular affairs. He carried His\ninstruction into the household, bringing families in their own homes\nunder the influence of His divine presence. His strong personal sympathy\nhelped to win hearts.

And it was\nrequired that all foreign coin should be changed for a coin called the\ntemple shekel, which was accepted for the service of the sanctuary.

The Jews were exceedingly\nproud of their piety. They rejoiced over their temple, and regarded a\nword spoken in its disfavor as blasphemy; they were very rigorous in the\nperformance of ceremonies connected with it; but the love of money had\noverruled their scruples.

Soon the\ntumultuous throng with their merchandise are far removed from the temple\nof the Lord. The courts are free from unholy traffic, and a deep silence\nand solemnity settles upon the scene of confusion. \u00a0The presence of the\nLord, that of old sanctified the mount, has now made sacred the temple\nreared in His honor. \u00a0{DA 158.3}",
                "In the cleansing of the temple, Jesus was announcing His mission as the\nMessiah, and entering upon His work. That temple, erected for the abode\nof the divine Presence, was designed to be an object lesson for Israel\nand for the world. From eternal ages it was God's purpose that every\ncreated being, from the bright and holy seraph to man, should be a\ntemple for the indwelling of the Creator. Because of sin, humanity\nceased to be a temple for God. Darkened and defiled by evil, the heart\nof man no longer revealed the glory of the Divine One. But by the\nincarnation of the Son of God, the purpose of Heaven is fulfilled. God\ndwells in humanity, and through saving grace the heart of man becomes\nagain His temple. God designed that the temple at Jerusalem should be a\ncontinual witness to the high destiny open to every soul. But the Jews\nhad not understood the significance of the building they regarded with\nso much pride. They did not yield themselves as holy temples for the\nDivine Spirit. The courts of the temple at Jerusalem, filled with the\ntumult of unholy traffic, represented all too truly the temple of the\nheart, defiled by the presence of sensual passion and unholy thoughts.\nIn cleansing the temple from the world's buyers and sellers, Jesus\nannounced His mission to cleanse the heart from the defilement of\nsin,---from the earthly desires, the selfish lusts, the evil habits,\nthat corrupt the soul. \"The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to\nHis temple, even the Messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in:\nbehold, He shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the\nday of His coming? and who shall stand when He appeareth? for He is like\na refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: and He shall sit as a refiner\nand purifier of silver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge\nthem as gold and silver.\" \u00a0Malachi 3:1-3. \u00a0{DA 161.1}",

If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God\ndestroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\" \u00a01\nCorinthians 3:16, 17. No man can of himself cast out the evil throng\nthat have taken possession of the heart. Only Christ can cleanse the\nsoul temple. But He will not force an entrance. He comes not into the\nheart as to the temple of old; but He says, \"Behold, I stand at the\ndoor, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will\ncome in to him.\" \u00a0Revelation 3:20. He will come, not for one day merely;\nfor He says, \"I will dwell in them, and walk in them; \\... and they\nshall \u00a0be My people.\" \"He will subdue our iniquities; and Thou wilt cast\nall their sins into the depths of the sea.\" \u00a02 Corinthians 6:16; \u00a0Micah\n7:19. His presence will cleanse and sanctify the soul, so that it may be\na holy temple unto the Lord, and \"an habitation of God through the\nSpirit.\" \u00a0Ephesians 2:21, 22. \u00a0{DA 161.2}",

Christ was the foundation and life of the\ntemple. Its services were typical of the sacrifice of the Son of God.\nThe priesthood was established to represent the mediatorial character\nand work of Christ. The entire plan of sacrificial worship was a\nforeshadowing of the Saviour's death to redeem the world.

It was doomed to\ndestruction. From that day sacrificial offerings and the service\nconnected with them were meaningless. Like the offering of Cain, they\ndid not express faith in the Saviour. In putting Christ to death, the\nJews virtually destroyed their temple. When Christ was crucified, the\ninner veil of the temple was rent in twain from top to bottom,\nsignifying that the great final sacrifice had been made, and that the\nsystem of sacrificial offerings was forever at an end. \u00a0{DA 165.4}",

Though rich, learned, and honored, he\nhad been strangely attracted by the humble Nazarene. The lessons that\nhad fallen from the Saviour's lips had greatly impressed him, and he\ndesired to learn more of these wonderful truths. \u00a0{DA 167.1}",
                "Christ's exercise of authority in the cleansing of the temple had roused\nthe determined hatred of the priests and rulers. They feared the power\nof this stranger. Such boldness on the part of an obscure Galilean was\nnot to be tolerated. They were bent on putting an end to His work. But\nnot all were agreed in this purpose. There were some that feared to\noppose One who was so evidently moved upon by the Spirit of God. They\nremembered how prophets had been slain for rebuking the sins of the\nleaders in Israel. They knew that the bondage of the Jews to a heathen\nnation was the result of their stubbornness in rejecting reproofs from\nGod. They feared that in plotting against Jesus the priests and rulers\nwere following in the steps of their fathers, and would bring fresh\ncalamities upon the nation. Nicodemus shared these feelings. In\na \u00a0council of the Sanhedrin, when the course to be pursued toward Jesus\nwas considered, Nicodemus advised caution and moderation. He urged that\nif Jesus was really invested with authority from God, it would be\nperilous to reject His warnings.

He resolved upon a secret\ninterview, excusing this on the ground that if he were to go openly,\nothers might follow his example. Learning by special inquiry the\nSaviour's place of retirement in the Mount of Olives, he waited until\nthe city was hushed in slumber, and then sought Him. \u00a0{DA 168.2}",

He had hoped for a better\nstate of things at the Messiah's coming. Yet the heart-searching message\nof the Baptist had failed to work in him conviction of sin. He was a\nstrict Pharisee, and prided himself on his good works.

But by virtue of his birth as an Israelite he regarded himself as\nsure of a place in the kingdom of God. He felt that he needed no change.\nHence his surprise at the Saviour's words. He was irritated by their\nclose application to himself. The pride of the Pharisee was struggling\nagainst the honest desire of the seeker after truth.

These may be received through meditating upon Him,\nthrough reading the Scriptures, or through hearing the word from the\nliving preacher.

Sinful thoughts\nare put away, evil deeds are renounced; love, humility, and peace take\nthe place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes the place of sadness,\nand the countenance reflects the light of heaven. No one sees the hand\nthat lifts the burden, or beholds the light descend from the courts\nabove.

But in order to maintain their own\npower, these leaders determined to break down the influence of Jesus.\nHis arraignment before the Sanhedrin, and an open condemnation of His\nteachings, would aid in effecting this; for the people still had great\nreverence for their religious leaders. Whoever dared to condemn the\nrabbinical requirements, or attempt to lighten the burdens they had\nbrought upon the people, was regarded as guilty, not only of blasphemy,\nbut of treason.

What\nhe could not accomplish by direct, personal effort, he determined to\neffect by strategy.

He planned to work through\nhis human agencies in the religious world, by imbuing them with his own\nenmity against the champion of truth.

In the territory east of Jordan, which was under the\ndominion of Antipas, much of John's ministry had been spent. Herod\nhimself had listened to the preaching of the Baptist.

He\nhad looked for the high places of human pride and power to be cast down.\nHe had pointed to the Messiah as the One whose fan was in His hand, and\nwho would thoroughly purge His floor, who would gather the wheat into\nHis garner, and burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

But God's messenger was of\nno such craven spirit. The multitudes who were gathered about Christ had\nbeen witnesses to the work of John. They had heard his fearless rebuke\nof sin. To the self-righteous Pharisees, the priestly Sadducees, King\nHerod and his court, princes and soldiers, publicans and peasants, John\nhad spoken with equal plainness. He was no trembling reed, swayed by the\nwinds of human praise or prejudice.

Rich apparel and\nthe luxuries of this life are not the portion of God's servants, but of\nthose who live \"in kings' courts,\" the rulers of this world, to whom\npertain its power and its riches. Jesus wished to direct attention to\nthe contrast between the clothing of John, and that worn by the priests\nand rulers. These officials arrayed themselves in rich robes and costly\nornaments. They loved display, and hoped to dazzle the people, and thus\ncommand greater consideration.

When the man returned to his friends, there was\ngreat \u00a0excitement. Notwithstanding the caution of Jesus, the man made no\nfurther effort to conceal the fact of his cure. It would indeed have\nbeen impossible to conceal it, but the leper published the matter\nabroad. Conceiving that it was only the modesty of Jesus which laid this\nrestriction upon him, he went about proclaiming the power of this Great\nHealer. He did not understand that every such manifestation made the\npriests and elders more determined to destroy Jesus. The restored man\nfelt that the boon of health was very precious. He rejoiced in the vigor\nof manhood, and in his restoration to his family and society, and felt\nit impossible to refrain from giving glory to the Physician who had made\nhim whole. But his act in blazing abroad the matter resulted in\nhindering the Saviour's work.

While He drew the publicans, the heathen, and\nthe Samaritans, He longed to reach the priests and teachers who were\nshut in by prejudice and tradition. He left untried no means by which\nthey might be reached. In sending the healed leper to the priests, He\ngave them a testimony calculated to disarm their prejudices. \u00a0{DA 265.1}",

Many hearts\nwere moved that for a time made no sign. During the Saviour's life, His\nmission seemed to call forth little response of love from the priests\nand teachers; but after His ascension \"a great company of the priests\nwere obedient to the faith.\" \u00a0Acts 6:7. \u00a0{DA 265.4}",

The disciples sought to prevent their Master from touching\nhim; for he who touched a leper became himself unclean. But in laying\nHis hand upon the leper, Jesus received no defilement. His touch\nimparted life-giving power. The leprosy was cleansed. Thus it is with\nthe leprosy of sin,---deep-rooted, deadly, and impossible to be cleansed\nby human power. \"The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From\nthe sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but\nwounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores.\" \u00a0Isaiah 1:5, 6.

They observed many of the rules prescribed by the rabbis, and\neven hoped to be justified by the works of the law. Fasting was\npracticed by the Jews as an act of merit, and the most rigid among them\nfasted two days in every week. The Pharisees and John's disciples were\nfasting when the latter came to Jesus with the inquiry, \"Why do we and\nthe Pharisees fast oft, but Thy disciples fast not?\" \u00a0{DA 276.4}",
                "Very tenderly Jesus answered them. He did not try to correct their\nerroneous conception of fasting, but only to set them right in regard to\nHis own mission. And He did this by employing the same figure that the\nBaptist himself had used in his testimony to Jesus. John had said, \"He\nthat hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom,\nwhich standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of \u00a0the\nbridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.\" \u00a0John 3:29.

Joy to the learned; He would open to them deeper\nmysteries than they had ever fathomed; truths that had been hidden from\nthe foundation of the world would be opened to men by the Saviour's\nmission. \u00a0{DA 277.1}",

In His last\nwords to them in the upper chamber, He said, \"A little while, and ye\nshall not see Me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see Me.\nVerily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the\nworld shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be\nturned into joy.\" \u00a0John 16:19, 20. \u00a0{DA 277.3}",

He desired them to give\nthe world the impression that they had been deceived and disappointed;\nbut by faith they were to look to the sanctuary above, where Jesus was\nministering for them; they were to open their hearts to the Holy Spirit,\nHis representative, and to rejoice in the light of His presence. Yet\ndays of temptation and trial would come, when they would be brought into\nconflict with the rulers of this world, and the leaders of the kingdom\nof darkness; when Christ was not personally \u00a0with them, and they failed\nto discern the Comforter, then it would be more fitting for them to\nfast. \u00a0{DA 277.4}",

Their hearts had\nbecome contracted, like the dried-up wine skins to which He had compared\nthem. While they remained satisfied with a legal religion, it was\nimpossible for them to become the depositaries of the living truth of\nheaven. They thought their own righteousness all-sufficient, and did not\ndesire that a new element should be brought into their religion. The\ngood will of God to men they did not accept as something apart from\nthemselves. They connected it with their own merit because of their good\nworks. The faith that works by love and purifies the soul could find no\nplace for union with the religion of the Pharisees, made up of\nceremonies and the injunctions of men. The effort to unite the teachings\nof Jesus with the established religion would be vain.

In the untutored fishermen, in the\npublican at the market place, in the woman of Samaria, in the common\npeople who heard Him gladly, He found His new bottles for the new wine.\nThe instrumentalities to be used in the gospel work are those souls who\ngladly receive the light which God sends them.

But the scribes and\nPharisees had no desire for the precious new wine. Until emptied of the\nold traditions, customs, and practices, they had no place in mind or\nheart for the teachings of Christ.

Rather than\ngive up some cherished idea, or discard some idol of opinion, many\nrefuse the truth which comes down from the Father of light. They trust\nin self, and depend upon their own wisdom, and do not realize their\nspiritual poverty. They insist on being saved in some way by which they\nmay perform some important work.

The solemn\nassembly for worship, the round of religious ceremonies, the external\nhumiliation, the imposing sacrifice, proclaim that the doer of these\nthings regards himself as righteous, and as entitled to heaven; but it\nis all a deception.

Faith and love are the gold tried in the fire. But with many\nthe gold has become dim, and the rich treasure has been lost.

                "When Jesus turned upon the Pharisees with the question whether it was\nlawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do evil, to save life or to\nkill, He confronted them with their own wicked purposes. They were\nhunting His life with bitter hatred, while He was saving life and\nbringing happiness to multitudes. Was it better to slay upon the\nSabbath, as they were planning to do, than to heal the afflicted, as He\nhad done? Was it more righteous to have murder in the heart upon God's\nholy day than love to all men, which finds expression in deeds of\nmercy? \u00a0{DA 287.1}",
                "In the healing of the withered hand, Jesus condemned the custom of the\nJews, and left the fourth commandment standing as God had given it. \"It\nis lawful to do well on the Sabbath days,\" He declared.

                "Those who hold that Christ abolished the law teach that He broke the\nSabbath and justified His disciples in doing the same.

In this they\ncontradict the testimony of Christ Himself, who declared, \"I have kept\nMy Father's commandments, and abide in His love.\" \u00a0John 15:10. Neither\nthe Saviour nor His followers broke the law of the Sabbath. Christ was a\nliving representative of the law. No violation of its holy precepts was\nfound in His life. Looking upon a nation of witnesses who were seeking\noccasion to condemn Him, He could say unchallenged, \"Which of you\nconvicteth Me of sin?\" \u00a0John 8:46, R. V. \u00a0{DA 287.3}",
                "The Saviour had not come to set aside what patriarchs and prophets had\nspoken; for He Himself had spoken through these representative men. All\nthe truths of God's word came from Him. But these priceless gems had\nbeen placed in false settings. Their precious light had been made to\nminister to error. God desired them to be removed from their \u00a0settings of\nerror and replaced in the framework of truth. This work only a divine\nhand could accomplish. By its connection with error, the truth had been\nserving the cause of the enemy of God and man.

                "\"The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,\" Jesus said.\nThe institutions that God has established are for the benefit of\nmankind. \"All things are for your sakes.\" \"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or\nCephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to\ncome; all are yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.\" \u00a02\nCorinthians 4:15; \u00a01 Corinthians 3:22, 23.

                "\"Wherefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.\" These words are\nfull of instruction and comfort. Because the Sabbath was made for man,\nit is the Lord's day. It belongs to Christ. For \"all things were made by\nHim; and without Him was not anything made that was made.\" \u00a0John 1:3.\nSince He made all things, He made the Sabbath. By Him it was set apart\nas a memorial of the work of creation. It points to Him as both the\nCreator and the Sanctifier. It declares that He who created all things\nin heaven and in earth, and by whom all things hold together, is the\nhead of the church, and that by His power we are reconciled to God. For,\nspeaking of Israel, He said, \"I gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign\nbetween Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that\nsanctify them,\"---make them holy. \u00a0Ezekiel 20:12. Then the Sabbath is a\nsign of Christ's power to make us holy. And it is given to all whom\nChrist makes holy. As a sign of His sanctifying power, the Sabbath is\ngiven to all who through Christ become a part of the Israel of God. \u00a0{DA\n288.2}",

To all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of\nChrist's creative and redeeming power, it will be a delight. Seeing\nChrist in it, they delight themselves in Him. The Sabbath points them to\nthe works of creation as an evidence of His mighty power in redemption.\nWhile it calls to mind the lost peace of Eden, it tells of peace\nrestored through the Saviour.

No\nsynagogue could have received the throngs that followed Him; but not for\nthis reason only did He choose to teach in the fields and groves. Jesus\nloved the scenes of nature. To Him each quiet retreat was a sacred\ntemple. \u00a0{DA 290.2}",

It was Christ who spoke with Abraham under the \u00a0oaks at Mamre;\nwith Isaac as he went out to pray in the fields at the eventide; with\nJacob on the hillside at Bethel; with Moses among the mountains of\nMidian; and with the boy David as he watched his flocks. It was at\nChrist's direction that for fifteen centuries the Hebrew people had left\ntheir homes for one week every year, and had dwelt in booths formed from\nthe green branches \"of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the\nboughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook.\" \u00a0Leviticus 23:40. \u00a0{DA\n290.3}",

And during His\nministry He loved to gather the people about Him under the blue heavens,\non some grassy hillside, or on the beach beside the lake. Here,\nsurrounded by the works of His own creation, He could turn the thoughts\nof His hearers from the artificial to the natural. In the growth and\ndevelopment of nature were revealed the principles of His kingdom. As\nmen should lift up their eyes to the hills of God, and behold the\nwonderful works of His hands, they could learn precious lessons of\ndivine truth. Christ's teaching would be repeated to them in the things\nof nature. So it is with all who go into the fields with Christ in their\nhearts.

Alone upon a mountain near the\nSea of Galilee He spent the entire night in prayer for them, while they\nwere sleeping at the foot of the mountain.

Peter, James, and John stood in\nstill nearer relationship to Him. They were almost constantly with Him,\nwitnessing His miracles, and hearing His words. John pressed into still\ncloser intimacy with Jesus, so that he is distinguished as the one whom\nJesus loved. The Saviour loved them all, but John's was the most\nreceptive spirit.

Although he had joined himself to Christ, yet his announcement\nof Him to Nathanael shows that he was not fully convinced of the\ndivinity of Jesus. Though Christ had been proclaimed by the voice from\nheaven as the Son of God, to Philip He was \"Jesus of Nazareth, the son\nof Joseph.\" \u00a0John 1:45. Again, when the five thousand were \u00a0fed, Philip's\nlack of faith was shown. It was to test him that Jesus questioned,\n\"Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?\" Philip's answer was on\nthe side of unbelief: \"Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient\nfor them, that every one of them may take a little.\" \u00a0John 6:5, 7. Jesus\nwas grieved. Although Philip had seen His works and felt His power, yet\nhe had not faith. When the Greeks inquired of Philip concerning Jesus,\nhe did not seize upon the opportunity of introducing them to the\nSaviour, but he went to tell Andrew. Again, in those last hours before\nthe crucifixion, the words of Philip were such as to discourage faith.\nWhen Thomas said to Jesus, \"Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; and\nhow can we know the way?\" the Saviour answered, \"I am the Way, the\nTruth, and the Life\\.... If ye had known Me, ye should have known My\nFather also.\" From Philip came the response of unbelief: \"Lord, show us\nthe Father, and it sufficeth us.\" \u00a0John 14:5-8.

The Saviour read\nthe heart of Judas; He knew the depths of iniquity to which, unless\ndelivered by the grace of God, Judas would sink. In connecting this man\nwith Himself, He placed him where he might, day by day, be brought in\ncontact with the outflowing of His own unselfish love.

He presented before Judas the heinous\ncharacter of greed, and many a time the disciple realized that his\ncharacter had been portrayed, and his sin pointed out; but he would not\nconfess and forsake his unrighteousness. He was self-sufficient, and\ninstead of resisting temptation, he continued to follow his fraudulent\npractices.

The truths He taught are no less important\nto us than to the multitude that followed Him. We no less than they need\nto learn the foundation principles of the kingdom of God. \u00a0{DA 299.3}",

It is a supernatural work, bringing a supernatural element into\nhuman nature. The soul that is yielded to Christ becomes His own\nfortress, which He holds in a revolted world, and He intends that no\nauthority shall be known in it but His own. A soul thus kept in\npossession by the heavenly agencies is impregnable to the assaults of\nSatan. But unless we do yield ourselves to the control of Christ, we\nshall be dominated by the wicked one. We must inevitably be under the\ncontrol of the one or the other of the two great powers that are\ncontending for the supremacy of the world. It is not necessary for us\ndeliberately to choose the service of the kingdom of darkness in order\nto come under its dominion. We have only to neglect to ally ourselves\nwith the kingdom of light. If we do not co-operate with the heavenly\nagencies, Satan will take possession of the heart, and will make it his\nabiding place. The only defense against evil is the indwelling of Christ\nin the heart through faith in His righteousness. Unless we become\nvitally connected with God, we can never resist the unhallowed effects\nof self-love, self-indulgence, and temptation to sin. We may leave off\nmany bad habits, for the time we may part company with Satan; but\nwithout a vital connection with God, through the surrender of ourselves\nto Him moment by moment, we shall be overcome.

The most common manifestation of the sin\nagainst the Holy Spirit is in persistently slighting Heaven's invitation\nto repent.

In their efforts to save themselves, they forgot Jesus; and it\nwas only when, in despair of self-dependence, they turned to Him that He\ncould give them help. \u00a0{DA 336.2}",
                "How often the disciples' experience is ours! When the tempests of\ntemptation gather, and the fierce lightnings flash, and the waves sweep\nover us, we battle with the storm alone, forgetting that there is One\nwho can help us. We trust to our own strength till our hope is lost, and\nwe are ready to perish. Then we remember Jesus, and if we call upon Him\nto save us, we shall not cry in vain. Though He sorrowfully reproves our\nunbelief and self-confidence, He never fails to give us the help we\nneed. Whether on the land or on the sea, if we have the Saviour in our\nhearts, there is no need of fear. Living faith in the Redeemer will\nsmooth the sea of life, and will deliver us from danger in the way that\nHe knows to be best. \u00a0{DA 336.3}",
                "There is another spiritual lesson in this miracle of the stilling of the\ntempest. Every man's experience testifies to the truth of the words of\nScripture, \"The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot\nrest\\.... There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.\" \u00a0Isaiah 57:20,\n21. Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued, we can find no\nrest. The masterful passions of the heart no human power can control. We\nare as helpless here as were the disciples to quiet the raging storm.\nBut He who spoke peace to the billows of Galilee has spoken the word of\npeace for every soul. However fierce the tempest, those who turn to\nJesus with the cry, \"Lord, save us,\" will find deliverance. His grace,\nthat reconciles the soul to God, quiets the strife of human passion, and\nin His love the heart is at rest. \"He maketh the storm a calm, so that\nthe waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be\nquiet; \u00a0so He bringeth them unto their desired haven.\" \u00a0Psalm 107:29, 30.\n\"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus\nChrist.\" \"The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of\nrighteousness quietness and assurance forever.\" \u00a0Romans 5:1; \u00a0Isaiah\n32:17. \u00a0{DA 336.4}",

But no sooner had they stepped upon the beach than their eyes\nwere greeted by a sight more terrible than the fury of the tempest. From\nsome hiding place among the tombs, two madmen rushed upon them as if to\ntear them in pieces. Hanging about these men were parts of chains which\nthey had broken in escaping from confinement. Their flesh was torn and\nbleeding where they had cut themselves with sharp stones. Their eyes\nglared out from their long and matted hair, the very likeness of\nhumanity seemed to have been blotted out by the demons that possessed\nthem, and they looked more like wild beasts than like men. \u00a0{DA 337.1}",

When the men, gnashing their teeth, and foaming at the mouth,\napproached Him, Jesus raised that hand which had beckoned the waves to\nrest, and the men could come no nearer. They stood raging but helpless\nbefore Him. \u00a0{DA 337.2}",

Upon a\nmountainside not far distant a great herd of swine was feeding. Into\nthese the demons asked to be allowed to enter, and Jesus suffered them.\nImmediately a panic seized the herd.

No one had\nbeen safe to pass the place where they were; for they would rush upon\nevery traveler with the fury of demons. Now these men were clothed and\nin their right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus, listening to His\nwords, and glorifying the name of Him who had made them whole. But the\npeople who beheld this wonderful scene did not rejoice. The loss of the\nswine seemed to them of greater moment than the deliverance of these\ncaptives of Satan. \u00a0{DA 338.3}",

They apprehended financial ruin, and\ndetermined to be freed from His presence. Those who had crossed the lake\nwith Jesus told of all that had happened on the preceding night, of\ntheir peril in the tempest, and how the wind and the sea had been\nstilled. But their words were without effect. In terror the people\nthronged about Jesus, beseeching Him to depart from them, and He\ncomplied, taking ship at once for the opposite shore. \u00a0{DA 339.1}",

We have\nnot the opportunity of turning from the person of Christ as had the\nGergesenes; but still there are many who refuse to obey His word,\nbecause obedience would involve the sacrifice of some worldly interest.\nLest His presence shall cause them pecuniary loss, many reject His\ngrace, and drive His Spirit from them. \u00a0{DA 339.2}",

In His presence they felt secure\nfrom the demons that had tormented their lives and wasted their manhood.\nAs Jesus was about to enter the boat, they kept close to His side, knelt\nat His feet, and begged Him to keep them near Him, where they might ever\nlisten to His words. But Jesus bade them go home and tell what great\nthings the Lord had done for them. \u00a0{DA 339.3}",

Great difficulties were sure to beset them\nin association with their heathen countrymen. And their long isolation\nfrom society seemed to have disqualified them for the work He had\nindicated. But as soon as Jesus pointed out their duty they were ready\nto obey. Not only did they tell their own households and neighbors about\nJesus, but they went throughout Decapolis, everywhere declaring His\npower to save, and describing how He had freed them from the demons. In\ndoing this work they could receive a greater \u00a0blessing than if, merely\nfor benefit to themselves, they had remained in His presence.

                "The two restored demoniacs were the first missionaries whom Christ sent\nto preach the gospel in the region of Decapolis. For a few moments only\nthese men had been privileged to hear the teachings of Christ. Not one\nsermon from His lips had ever fallen upon their ears. They could not\ninstruct the people as the disciples who had been daily with Christ were\nable to do. But they bore in their own persons the evidence that Jesus\nwas the Messiah. They could tell what they knew; what they themselves\nhad seen, and heard, and felt of the power of Christ. This is what\neveryone can do whose heart has been touched by the grace of God. John,\nthe beloved disciple, wrote: \"That which was from the beginning, which\nwe have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked\nupon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; \\... that which\nwe have seen and heard declare we unto you.\" \u00a01 John 1:1-3. As witnesses\nfor Christ, we are to tell what we know, what we ourselves have seen and\nheard and felt. If we have been following Jesus step by step, we shall\nhave something right to the point to tell concerning the way in which He\nhas led us. We can tell how we have tested His promise, and found the\npromise true. We can bear witness to what we have known of the grace of\nChrist. This is the witness for which our Lord calls, and for want of\nwhich the world is perishing. \u00a0{DA 340.1}",
                "Though the people of Gergesa had not received Jesus, He did not leave\nthem to the darkness they had chosen. When they bade Him depart from\nthem, they had not heard His words. They were ignorant of that which\nthey were rejecting. Therefore He again sent the light to them, and by\nthose to whom they would not refuse to listen. \u00a0{DA 340.2}",
                "In causing the destruction of the swine, it was Satan's purpose to turn\nthe people away from the Saviour, and prevent the preaching of the\ngospel in that region. But this very occurrence roused the whole country\nas nothing else could have done, and directed attention to Christ.\nThough the Saviour Himself departed, the men whom He had healed remained\nas witnesses to His power. Those who had been mediums of the prince of\ndarkness became channels of light, messengers of the Son of God. Men\nmarveled as they listened to the wondrous news. A door was opened to the\ngospel throughout that region. When Jesus returned to Decapolis, the\npeople flocked about Him, and for three \u00a0days, not merely the inhabitants\nof one town, but thousands from all the surrounding region, heard the\nmessage of salvation.

                "The encounter with the demoniacs of Gergesa had a lesson for the\ndisciples. It showed the depths of degradation to which Satan is seeking\nto drag the whole human race, and the mission of Christ to set men free\nfrom his power. Those wretched beings, dwelling in the place of graves,\npossessed by demons, in bondage to uncontrolled passions and loathsome\nlusts, represent what humanity would become if given up to satanic\njurisdiction. Satan's influence is constantly exerted upon men to\ndistract the senses, control the mind for evil, and incite to violence\nand crime. He weakens the body, darkens the intellect, and debases the\nsoul. Whenever men reject the Saviour's invitation, they are yielding\nthemselves to Satan. Multitudes in every department in life, in the\nhome, in business, and even in the church, are doing this today. It is\nbecause of this that violence and crime have overspread the earth, and\nmoral darkness, like the pall of death, enshrouds the habitations of\nmen. Through his specious temptations Satan leads men to worse and worse\nevils, till utter depravity and ruin are the result. The only safeguard\nagainst his power is found in the presence of Jesus. Before men and\nangels Satan has been revealed as man's enemy and destroyer; Christ, as\nman's friend and deliverer. His Spirit will develop in man all that will\nennoble the character and dignify the nature.

The presence of the crowd, and the\ntumult jarred upon the spirit of Jesus. He tried to silence them,\nsaying, \"Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but\nsleepeth.\" They were indignant at the words of the Stranger. They had\nseen the child in the embrace of death, and they laughed Him to scorn.\nRequiring them all to leave the house, Jesus took with Him the father\nand mother of the maiden, and the three disciples, Peter, James, and\nJohn, and together they entered the chamber of death. \u00a0{DA 343.1}",

In that one touch was\nconcentrated the faith of her life, and instantly her pain and\nfeebleness gave place to the vigor of perfect health. \u00a0{DA 343.5}",

To talk of religion in a casual\nway, to pray without soul hunger and living faith, avails nothing. A\nnominal faith in Christ, which accepts Him merely as the Saviour of the\nworld, can never bring healing to the soul. The faith that is unto\nsalvation is not a mere intellectual assent to the truth. He who waits\nfor entire knowledge before he will exercise faith, cannot receive\nblessing from God. It is not enough to believe \u00a0*about* \u00a0Christ; we must\nbelieve \u00a0*in* \u00a0Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that which\nembraces Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to\nourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a transaction\nby which those who receive Christ join themselves in covenant relation\nwith God. Genuine faith is life.

But they needed also an experience in laboring alone.\nThey were still in need of much instruction, great patience and\ntenderness.

Where He had passed, the objects of His\ncompassion were rejoicing in health, and making trial of their new-found\npowers. Crowds were collecting around them to hear from their lips the\nworks that the Lord had wrought.

Nothing must be allowed to divert their\nminds from their great work, or in any way excite opposition and close\nthe door for further labor. They were not to adopt the dress of the\nreligious teachers, nor use any guise in apparel to distinguish them\nfrom the humble peasants. They were not to enter into the synagogues and\ncall the people together for public service; their efforts were to be\nput forth in house-to-house labor. They were not to waste time in\nneedless salutations, or in going from house to house for entertainment.\nBut in every place they were to accept the hospitality of those who were\nworthy, those who would welcome them heartily as if entertaining Christ\nHimself. They were to enter the dwelling with the beautiful salutation,\n\"Peace be to this house.\" \u00a0Luke 10:5.

God\nhas \u00a0appointed to every man his work, according to his ability (Ephesians\n4:11-13), and He would not have a few weighted with responsibilities\nwhile others have no burden, no travail of soul. \u00a0{DA 361.4}",
                "Christ's words of compassion are spoken to His workers today just as\nsurely as they were spoken to His disciples. \"Come ye yourselves apart,\n\\... and rest awhile,\" He says to those who are worn and weary. It is\nnot wise to be always under the strain of work and excitement, even in\nministering to men's spiritual needs; for in this way personal piety is\nneglected, and the powers of mind and soul and body are overtaxed.\nSelf-denial is required of the disciples of Christ, and sacrifices must\nbe made; but care must also be exercised lest through their overzeal\nSatan take advantage of the weakness of humanity, and the work of God be\nmarred. \u00a0{DA 362.1}",

Thus they separated their souls from God, and\nbuilt themselves up in self-sufficiency. The same dangers still exist.\nAs activity increases and men become successful in doing any work for\nGod, there is danger of trusting to human plans and methods. There is a\ntendency to pray less, and to have less faith. Like the disciples, we\nare in danger of losing sight of our dependence on God, and seeking to\nmake a savior of our activity. We need to look constantly to Jesus,\nrealizing that it is His power which does the work. While we are to\nlabor earnestly for the salvation of the lost, we must also take time\nfor meditation, for prayer, and for the study of the word of God.

Again and again in the history of His earthly\nlife are found records such as these: \"Rising up a great while before\nday, He went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.\"\n\"Great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of\ntheir infirmities. And He withdrew Himself into the wilderness, and\nprayed.\" \"And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into a\nmountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.\" \u00a0Mark\n1:35; \u00a0Luke 5:15, 16; \u00a06:12. \u00a0{DA 362.3}",

He must turn aside from a life\nof ceaseless activity and contact with human needs, to seek retirement\nand unbroken communion with His Father. As one with us, a sharer in our\nneeds and weaknesses, He was wholly dependent upon God, and in the\nsecret place of prayer He sought divine strength, that He might go forth\nbraced for duty and trial. In a world of sin Jesus endured struggles and\ntorture of soul. In communion with God He could unburden the sorrows\nthat were crushing Him. Here He found comfort and joy. \u00a0{DA 362.4}",

If today\nwe would take time to go to Jesus and tell Him our needs, we should not\nbe disappointed; He would be at our right hand to help us.

The disciples thought they\nhad retired where they would not be disturbed; but as soon as the\nmultitude missed the divine Teacher, they inquired, \"Where is He?\" Some\namong them had noticed the direction in which Christ and His disciples\nhad gone. Many went by land to meet them, while others followed in their\nboats across the water. The Passover was at hand, and, from far and\nnear, bands of pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem gathered to see Jesus.\nAdditions were made to their number, until there were assembled five\nthousand men besides women and children. Before Christ reached the\nshore, a multitude were waiting for Him. But He landed unobserved by\nthem, and spent a little time apart with the disciples. \u00a0{DA 364.1}",

He \"was moved with\ncompassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a\nshepherd.\" Leaving His retreat, He found a convenient place where He\ncould minister to them. They received no help from \u00a0the priests and\nrulers; but the healing waters of life flowed from Christ as He taught\nthe multitude the way of salvation. \u00a0{DA 364.2}",
                "The people listened to the words of mercy flowing so freely from the\nlips of the Son of God. They heard the gracious words, so simple and so\nplain that they were as the balm of Gilead to their souls. The healing\nof His divine hand brought gladness and life to the dying, and ease and\nhealth to those suffering with disease. The day seemed to them like\nheaven upon earth, and they were utterly unconscious of how long it had\nbeen since they had eaten anything. \u00a0{DA 365.1}",
                "At length the day was far spent. The sun was sinking in the west, and\nyet the people lingered.

                "The disciples finally came to Him, urging that for their own sake the\npeople should be sent away. Many had come from far, and had eaten\nnothing since morning. In the surrounding towns and villages they might\nbe able to buy food. But Jesus said, \"Give ye them to eat,\" and then,\nturning to Philip, questioned, \"Whence shall we buy bread, that these\nmay eat?\" This He said to test the faith of the disciple. Philip looked\nover the sea of heads, and thought how impossible it would be to provide\nfood to satisfy the wants of such a crowd. He answered that two hundred\npennyworth of bread would not be nearly enough to divide among them, so\nthat each might have a little. Jesus inquired how much food could be\nfound among the company. \"There is a lad here,\" said Andrew, \"which hath\nfive barley loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so\nmany?\" Jesus directed that these be brought to Him. Then He bade the\ndisciples seat the people on the grass in parties of fifty or a hundred,\nto preserve order, and that all might witness what He was about to do.\nWhen this was accomplished, Jesus took the food, \"and looking up to\nheaven, He blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to His disciples, and\nthe disciples to the multitude.\" \"And they did all eat, and were filled.\nAnd they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the\nfishes.\" \u00a0{DA 365.3}",

They had been so intensely interested \u00a0in Christ's\nwords that they had not once thought of sitting down, and the crowd was\nso great that there was danger of their trampling on one another. Jesus\nwould give them a chance to rest, and He bade them sit down. There was\nmuch grass in the place, and all could rest in comfort. \u00a0{DA 365.4}",
                "Christ never worked a miracle except to supply a genuine necessity, and\nevery miracle was of a character to lead the people to the tree of life,\nwhose leaves are for the healing of the nations. The simple food \u00a0passed\nround by the hands of the disciples contained a whole treasure of\nlessons. It was humble fare that had been provided; the fishes and\nbarley loaves were the daily food of the fisher folk about the Sea of\nGalilee. Christ could have spread before the people a rich repast, but\nfood prepared merely for the gratification of appetite would have\nconveyed no lesson for their good. Christ taught them in this lesson\nthat the natural provisions of God for man had been perverted. And never\ndid people enjoy the luxurious feasts prepared for the gratification of\nperverted taste as this people enjoyed the rest and the simple food\nwhich Christ provided so far from human habitations. \u00a0{DA 366.1}",
                "If men today were simple in their habits, living in harmony with\nnature's laws, as did Adam and Eve in the beginning, there would be an\nabundant supply for the needs of the human family. There would be fewer\nimaginary wants, and more opportunities to work in God's ways.

To that great throng, weary and hungry after the long,\nexciting day, the simple fare was an assurance not only of His power,\nbut of His tender care for them in the common needs of life. The Saviour\nhas not promised His followers the luxuries of the world; their fare may\nbe plain, and even scanty; their lot may be shut in by poverty; but His\nword is pledged that their need shall be supplied, and He has promised\nthat which is far better than worldly good,---the abiding comfort of His\nown presence. \u00a0{DA 367.2}",
                "In feeding the five thousand, Jesus lifts the veil from the world of\nnature, and reveals the power that is constantly exercised for our good.\nIn the production of earth's harvests God is working a miracle every\nday. Through natural agencies the same work is accomplished that was\nwrought in the feeding of the multitude. Men prepare the soil and sow\nthe seed, but it is the life from God that causes the seed to germinate.\nIt is God's rain and air and sunshine that cause it to put forth, \"first\nthe blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" \u00a0Mark\n4:28. It is God who is every day feeding millions from earth's harvest\nfields. Men are called upon to co-operate with God in the care of the\ngrain and the preparation of the loaf, and because of this they lose\nsight of the divine agency. They do not give God the glory due unto \u00a0His\nholy name. The working of His power is ascribed to natural causes or to\nhuman instrumentality. Man is glorified in place of God, and His\ngracious gifts are perverted to selfish uses, and made a curse instead\nof a blessing. God is seeking to change all this. He desires that our\ndull senses shall be quickened to discern His merciful kindness and to\nglorify Him for the working of His power. He desires us to recognize Him\nin His gifts, that they may be, as He intended, a blessing to us. It was\nto accomplish this purpose that the miracles of Christ were\nperformed. \u00a0{DA 367.3}",
                "After the multitude had been fed, there was an abundance of food left.\nBut He who had all the resources of infinite power at His command said,\n\"Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\" These words\nmeant more than putting the bread into the baskets. The lesson was\ntwofold. Nothing is to be wasted. We are to let slip no temporal\nadvantage. We should neglect nothing that will tend to benefit a human\nbeing. Let everything be gathered up that will relieve the necessity of\nearth's hungry ones. And there should be the same carefulness in\nspiritual things. When the baskets of fragments were collected, the\npeople thought of their friends at home. They wanted them to share in\nthe bread that Christ had blessed. The contents of the baskets were\ndistributed among the eager throng, and were carried away into all the\nregion round about. So those who were at the feast were to give to\nothers the bread that comes down from heaven, to satisfy the hunger of\nthe soul.

Not one word that concerned their\neternal salvation was to fall useless to the ground. \u00a0{DA 368.1}",
                "The miracle of the loaves teaches a lesson of dependence upon God. When\nChrist fed the five thousand, the food was not nigh at hand. Apparently\nHe had no means at His command. Here He was, with five thousand men,\nbesides women and children, in the wilderness. He had not invited the\nlarge multitude to follow Him; they came without invitation or command;\nbut He knew that after they had listened so long to His instruction,\nthey would feel hungry and faint; for He was one with them in their need\nof food. They were far from home, and the night was close at hand. Many\nof them were without means to purchase food. He who for their sake had\nfasted forty days in the wilderness would not suffer them to return\nfasting to their homes. The providence of God had placed Jesus where He\nwas; and He depended on His heavenly Father for the means to relieve the\nnecessity. \u00a0{DA 368.2}",
                "And when we are brought into strait places, we are to depend on God. We\nare to exercise wisdom and judgment in every action of life, that we may\nnot, by reckless movements, place ourselves in trial. We are not to\nplunge into difficulties, neglecting the means God has provided, and\nmisusing the faculties He has given us. Christ's workers are to obey His\ninstructions implicitly. The work is God's, and if we would bless others\nHis plans must be followed. Self cannot be made a center; self can\nreceive no honor. If we plan according to our own ideas, the Lord will\nleave us to our own mistakes. But when, after following His directions,\nwe are brought into strait places, He will deliver us. We are not to\ngive up in discouragement, but in every emergency we are to seek help\nfrom Him who has infinite resources at His command. Often we shall be\nsurrounded with trying circumstances, and then, in the fullest\nconfidence, we must depend upon God.

He has bidden us, \"Go ye into all the world, and\npreach the gospel to every creature.\" \u00a0Mark 16:15. But how often our\nhearts sink, and faith fails us, as we see how great is the need, and\nhow small the means in our hands. Like Andrew looking upon the five\nbarley loaves and the two little fishes, we exclaim, \"What are they\namong so many?\" Often we hesitate, unwilling to give all that we have,\nfearing to spend and to be spent for others. But Jesus has bidden us,\n\"Give \u00a0*ye* \u00a0them to eat.\" His command is a promise; and behind it is the\nsame power that fed the multitude beside the sea. \u00a0{DA 369.2}",
                "In Christ's act of supplying the temporal necessities of a hungry\nmultitude is wrapped up a deep spiritual lesson for all His workers.\nChrist received from the Father; He imparted to the disciples; they\nimparted to the multitude; and the people to one another.

This should be a great encouragement to His disciples today.\nChrist is the great center, the source of all strength. His disciples\nare to receive their supplies from Him. The most intelligent, the most\nspiritually minded, can bestow only as they receive. Of themselves they\ncan supply nothing for the needs of the soul. We can impart only that\nwhich we receive from Christ; and we can receive only as we impart to\nothers. As we continue imparting, we continue to receive; and the more\nwe impart, the more we shall receive. Thus we may be constantly\nbelieving, trusting, receiving, and imparting. \u00a0{DA 370.1}",

He is in danger of shifting his burden upon\norganizations, instead of relying upon Him who is the source of all\nstrength. It is a great mistake to trust in human wisdom or numbers in\nthe work of God. Successful work for Christ depends not so much on\nnumbers or talent as upon pureness of purpose, the true simplicity of\nearnest, dependent faith.

They were to be grievously tried. Their long-cherished hopes,\nbased on a popular delusion, were to be disappointed in a most painful\nand humiliating manner. In the place of His exaltation to the throne of\nDavid they were to witness His crucifixion. This was to be indeed His\ntrue coronation. But they did not discern this, and in consequence\nstrong temptations would come to them, which it would be difficult for\nthem to recognize as temptations. Without the Holy Spirit to enlighten\nthe mind and enlarge the comprehension the faith of the disciples would\nfail. It was painful to Jesus that their conceptions of His kingdom\nwere, to so great a degree, limited to worldly aggrandizement and honor.\nFor them the burden was heavy upon His heart, and He poured out His\nsupplications with bitter agony and tears. \u00a0{DA 379.1}",

To be\nunited with a teacher who could work mighty miracles, and yet to be\nreviled as deceivers, was a trial they could ill endure. Were they\nalways to be accounted followers of a false prophet? Would Christ never\nassert His authority as king? Why did not He who possessed such power\nreveal Himself in His true character, and make their way less painful?\nWhy had He not saved John the Baptist from a violent death?

Multitudes who desired to\nexalt Him to the throne today would turn from Him tomorrow. The\ndisappointment of their selfish ambition would turn their love to\nhatred, and their praise to curses. Yet knowing this, He took no\nmeasures to avert the crisis. From the first He had held out to His\nfollowers no hope of earthly rewards. To one who came desiring to become\nHis disciple He had said, \"The foxes have holes, and the birds of the\nair have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay His\nhead.\" \u00a0Matthew 8:20.

The fact that He claimed to be the\nSent of God, and yet refused to be Israel's king, was a mystery which\nthey could not fathom. His refusal was misinterpreted.

It\nwas Christ Himself who had led the Hebrews through the wilderness, and\nhad daily fed them with the bread from heaven. That food was a type of\nthe real bread from heaven.

                "The figure which Christ used was a familiar one to the Jews. Moses, by\nthe inspiration of the Holy Spirit, had said, \"Man doth not live by\nbread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the\nLord.\" And the prophet Jeremiah had written, \"Thy words were found, and\nI did eat them; and Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine\nheart.\" \u00a0Deuteronomy 8:3; \u00a0Jeremiah 15:16. The rabbis themselves had a\nsaying, that the eating of bread, in its spiritual significance, was the\nstudy of the law and the practice of good works; and it was often said\nthat at the Messiah's coming all Israel would be fed. The teaching of\nthe prophets made plain the deep spiritual lesson in the miracle of the\nloaves. This lesson Christ was seeking to open to His hearers in the\nsynagogue. Had they understood the Scriptures, they would have\nunderstood His words when He said, \"I am the bread of life.\" Only the\nday before, the great multitude, when faint and weary, had been fed by\nthe bread which He had given.

They\ncontemptuously alluded to His life as a Galilean laborer, and to His\nfamily as being poor and lowly. The claims of this uneducated carpenter,\nthey said, were unworthy of their attention. And on account of His\nmysterious birth they insinuated that He was of doubtful parentage, thus\nrepresenting the human circumstances of His birth as a blot upon His\nhistory. \u00a0{DA 387.1}",

But Jesus showed how vain is this claim; for He\nsaid, \"Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the\nFather, cometh unto Me.\" Only through Christ could they receive a\nknowledge of the Father. Humanity could not endure the vision of His\nglory.

From time to time precious rays of light from Jesus shone\nupon them, yet often they were like men groping among shadows. But on\nthis day, before they were brought face to face with the great trial of\ntheir faith, the Holy Spirit rested upon them in power. For a little\ntime their eyes were turned away from \"the things which are seen,\" to\nbehold \"the things which are not seen.\" \u00a02 Corinthians 4:18. Beneath the\nguise of humanity they discerned the glory of the Son of God. \u00a0{DA 412.1}",

                "The truth which Peter had confessed is the foundation of the believer's\nfaith. It is that which Christ Himself has declared to be eternal life.\nBut the possession of this knowledge was no ground for\nself-glorification. Through no wisdom or goodness of his own had it been\nrevealed to Peter. Never can humanity, of itself, attain to a knowledge\nof the divine. \"It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than\nhell; what canst thou know?\" \u00a0Job 11:8. Only the spirit of adoption can\nreveal to us the deep things of God, which \"eye hath not seen, nor ear\nheard, neither have entered into the heart of man.\" \"God hath revealed\nthem unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea,\nthe deep things of God.\" \u00a01 Corinthians 2:9, 10. \"The secret of the Lord\nis with them that fear Him;\" and the fact that Peter discerned the glory\nof Christ was an evidence that he had been \"taught of God.\" \u00a0Psalm\n25:14; \u00a0John 6:45.

                "Jesus continued: \"I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon\nthis rock I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall not\nprevail \u00a0against it.\" The word Peter signifies a stone,---a rolling\nstone. Peter was not the rock upon which the church was founded. The\ngates of hell did prevail against him when he denied his Lord with\ncursing and swearing. The church was built upon One against whom the\ngates of hell could not prevail. \u00a0{DA 412.4}",

Peter himself,\nwriting by inspiration, applies this prophecy to Jesus. He says, \"If ye\nhave tasted that the Lord is gracious: unto whom coming, a living stone,\nrejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious, ye also, as living\nstones, are built up a spiritual house.\" \u00a01 Peter 2:3-5, R.

Many claim that a position of trust\nin the church gives them authority to dictate what other men shall\nbelieve and what they shall do. This claim God does not sanction. The\nSaviour declares, \"All ye are brethren.\" All are exposed to temptation,\nand are liable to error. Upon no finite being can we depend for\nguidance. The Rock of faith is the living presence of Christ in the\nchurch. Upon this the weakest may depend, and those who think themselves\nthe strongest will prove to be the weakest, unless they make Christ\ntheir efficiency. \"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh\nflesh his arm.\" The Lord \"is the Rock, His work is perfect.\" \"Blessed\nare all they that put their trust in Him.\" \u00a0Jeremiah 17:5; \u00a0Deuteronomy\n32:4; \u00a0Psalm 2:12. \u00a0{DA 414.3}",
                "After Peter's confession, Jesus charged the disciples to tell no man\nthat He was the Christ.

But day by day He was revealing Himself to them as the\nSaviour, and thus He desired to give them a true conception of Him as\nthe Messiah. \u00a0{DA 414.4}",

That the hatred of the priests and\nrabbis would never be overcome, that Christ would be rejected by His own\nnation, condemned as a deceiver, and crucified as a malefactor,---such a\nthought the disciples had never entertained.

But the disciples did not\nhear this, and had they heard, would not have understood. But now they\nhave been with Jesus, listening to His words, beholding His works,\nuntil, notwithstanding the humility of His surroundings, and the\nopposition of priests and people, they can join in the testimony of\nPeter, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" Now the time\nhas come for the veil that hides the future to be withdrawn. \"From that\ntime forth began Jesus to show unto His disciples, how that He must go\nunto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests\nand scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.\" \u00a0{DA\n415.2}",

Peter's words were not such as\nwould be a help and solace to Jesus in the great trial before Him. They\nwere not in harmony with God's purpose of grace toward a lost world, nor\nwith the lesson of self-sacrifice that Jesus had come to teach by His\nown example. Peter did not desire to see the cross in the work of\nChrist. The impression which his words would make was directly opposed\nto that which Christ desired to make on the minds of His followers, and\nthe Saviour was moved to utter one of the sternest rebukes \u00a0that ever\nfell from His lips: \"Get thee behind Me, Satan: thou art an offense unto\nMe: for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be\nof men.\" \u00a0{DA 415.4}",

The prince\nof evil was the author of the thought. His instigation was behind that\nimpulsive appeal. In the wilderness, Satan had offered Christ the\ndominion of the world on condition of forsaking the path of humiliation\nand sacrifice. Now he was presenting the same temptation to the disciple\nof Christ. He was seeking to fix Peter's gaze upon the earthly glory,\nthat he might not behold the cross to which Jesus desired to turn his\neyes. And through Peter, Satan was again pressing the temptation upon\nJesus. But the Saviour heeded it not; His thought was for His disciple.\nSatan had interposed between Peter and his Master, that the heart of the\ndisciple might not be touched at the vision of Christ's humiliation for\nhim. The words of Christ were spoken, not to Peter, but to the one who\nwas trying to separate him from his Redeemer. \"Get thee behind Me,\nSatan.\" No longer interpose between Me and My erring servant.

                "It was to Peter a bitter lesson, and one which he learned but slowly,\nthat the path of Christ on earth lay through agony and humiliation. The\ndisciple shrank from fellowship with his Lord in suffering. But in the\nheat of the furnace fire he was to learn its blessing. Long afterward,\nwhen his active form was bowed with the burden of years and labors, he\nwrote, \"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which\nis to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but\nrejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when\nHis glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.\" \u00a01\nPeter 4:12, 13. \u00a0{DA 416.2}",

Calling about\nHim, with the disciples, the people who had been lingering near, He\nsaid, \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up\nhis cross daily, and follow Me.\" The cross was associated with the power\nof Rome. It was the instrument of the most cruel and humiliating form of\ndeath. The lowest criminals were required to bear the cross to the place\nof execution; and often as it was about to be laid upon their shoulders,\nthey resisted with desperate violence, until they were overpowered,\nand \u00a0the instrument of torture was bound upon them. But Jesus bade His\nfollowers take up the cross and bear it after Him. To the disciples His\nwords, though dimly comprehended, pointed to their submission to the\nmost bitter humiliation,---submission even unto death for the sake of\nChrist. No more complete self-surrender could the Saviour's words have\npictured. But all this He had accepted for them. Jesus did not count\nheaven a place to be desired while we were lost. He left the heavenly\ncourts for a life of reproach and insult, and a death of shame. He who\nwas rich in heaven's priceless treasure, became poor, that through His\npoverty we might be rich.

Even Peter had not a word to say. Gladly\nwould they have lingered in that holy place which had been touched with\nthe light of heaven, and where the Son of God had manifested His glory;\nbut there was work to be done for the people, who were already searching\nfar and near for Jesus. \u00a0{DA 426.1}",
                "At the foot of the mountain a large company had gathered, led hither by\nthe disciples who had remained behind, but who knew whither Jesus had\nresorted. As the Saviour drew near, He charged His three companions to\nkeep silence concerning what they had witnessed, saying, \"Tell the\nvision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.\"\nThe revelation made to the disciples was to be pondered in their own\nhearts, not to be published abroad. To relate it to the multitudes would\nexcite only ridicule or idle wonder. And even the nine apostles would\nnot understand the scene until after Christ had risen from the dead. How\nslow of comprehension even the three favored disciples were, is seen in\nthe fact that notwithstanding all that Christ had said of what was\nbefore Him, they queried among themselves what the rising from the\ndead \u00a0should mean. Yet they asked no explanation from Jesus. His words in\nregard to the future had filled them with sorrow; they sought no further\nrevelation concerning that which they were fain to believe might never\ncome to pass. \u00a0{DA 426.2}",

As they went forth strong in faith, the evil spirits\nhad obeyed their word. Now in the name of Christ they commanded the\ntorturing spirit to leave his victim; but the demon only mocked them by\na fresh display of his power. The disciples, unable to account for their\ndefeat, felt that they were bringing dishonor upon themselves and their\nMaster. And in the crowd there were scribes who made the most of this\nopportunity to humiliate them. Pressing around the disciples, they plied\nthem with questions, seeking to prove that they and their Master were\ndeceivers.

Lucifer had said, \"I will be like the\nMost High\" (Isaiah 14:12, 14); and the desire for self-exaltation had\nbrought strife into the heavenly courts, and had banished a multitude of\nthe hosts of God. Had Lucifer really desired to be like the Most High,\nhe would never have deserted his appointed place in heaven; for the\nspirit of the Most High is manifested in unselfish ministry. Lucifer\ndesired God's power, but not His character. He sought for himself the\nhighest \u00a0place, and every being who is actuated by his spirit will do the\nsame. Thus alienation, discord, and strife will be inevitable. Dominion\nbecomes the prize of the strongest.

                "Day after day He taught the people, until the last, \"that great day of\nthe feast.\" The morning of this day found the people wearied from the\nlong season of festivity. Suddenly Jesus lifted up His voice, in tones\nthat rang through the courts of the temple: \u00a0{DA 453.3}",
                "\"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth\non Me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of\nliving water.\" The condition of the people made this appeal very\nforcible. They had been engaged in a continued scene of pomp and\nfestivity, their eyes had been dazzled with light and color, and their\nears regaled with the richest music; but there had been nothing in all\nthis round of ceremonies to meet the wants of the spirit, nothing\nto \u00a0satisfy the thirst of the soul for that which perishes not. Jesus\ninvited them to come and drink of the fountain of life, of that which\nwould be in them a well of water, springing up unto everlasting\nlife. \u00a0{DA 453.4}",
                "The priest had that morning performed the ceremony which commemorated\nthe smiting of the rock in the wilderness. That rock was a symbol of Him\nwho by His death would cause living streams of salvation to flow to all\nwho are athirst. Christ's words were the water of life. There in the\npresence of the assembled multitude He set Himself apart to be smitten,\nthat the water of life might flow to the world. In smiting Christ, Satan\nthought to destroy the Prince of life; but from the smitten rock there\nflowed living water. As Jesus thus spoke to the people, their hearts\nthrilled with a strange awe, and many were ready to exclaim, with the\nwoman of Samaria, \"Give me this water, that I thirst not.\" \u00a0John\n4:15. \u00a0{DA 454.1}",
                "Jesus knew the wants of the soul. Pomp, riches, and honor cannot satisfy\nthe heart. \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me.\" The rich, the\npoor, the high, the low, are alike welcome. He promises to relieve the\nburdened mind, to comfort the sorrowing, and to give hope to the\ndespondent. Many of those who heard Jesus were mourners over\ndisappointed hopes, many were nourishing a secret grief, many were\nseeking to satisfy their restless longing with the things of the world\nand the praise of men; but when all was gained, they found that they had\ntoiled only to reach a broken cistern, from which they could not quench\ntheir thirst. Amid the glitter of the joyous scene they stood,\ndissatisfied and sad. That sudden cry, \"If any man thirst,\" startled\nthem from their sorrowful meditation, and as they listened to the words\nthat followed, their minds kindled with a new hope. The Holy Spirit\npresented the symbol before them until they saw in it the offer of the\npriceless gift of salvation. \u00a0{DA 454.2}",

Jesus is still crying, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me,\nand drink.\" \"Let him that is athirst come.

The priests\nand rulers were watching to entrap Him. They were planning to stop Him\nby violence. But this was not all. They wanted to humble this Galilean\nrabbi before the people. \u00a0{DA 455.1}",
                "On the first day of His presence at the feast, the rulers had come to\nHim, demanding by what authority He taught. They wished to divert\nattention from Him to the question of His right to teach, and thus to\ntheir own importance and authority. \u00a0{DA 455.2}",
                "\"My teaching is not Mine,\" said Jesus, \"but His that sent Me. If any man\nwilleth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it be of\nGod, or whether I speak from Myself.\" \u00a0John 7:16, 17, R. V. The question\nof these cavilers Jesus met, not by answering the cavil, but by opening\nup truth vital to the salvation of the soul. The perception and\nappreciation of truth, He said, depends less upon the mind than upon the\nheart. Truth must be received into the soul; it claims the homage of the\nwill. If truth could be submitted to the reason alone, pride would be no\nhindrance in the way of its reception. But it is to be received through\nthe work of grace in the heart; and its reception depends upon the\nrenunciation of every sin that the Spirit of God reveals. Man's\nadvantages for obtaining a knowledge of the truth, however great these\nmay be, will prove of no benefit to him unless the heart is open to\nreceive \u00a0the truth, and there is a conscientious surrender of every habit\nand practice that is opposed to its principles. To those who thus yield\nthemselves to God, having an honest desire to know and to do His will,\nthe truth is revealed as the power of God for their salvation. These\nwill be able to distinguish between him who speaks for God, and him who\nspeaks merely from himself. The Pharisees had not put their will on the\nside of God's will. They were not seeking to know the truth, but to find\nsome excuse for evading it; Christ showed that this was why they did not\nunderstand His teaching. \u00a0{DA 455.3}",
                "He now gave a test by which the true teacher might be distinguished from\nthe deceiver: \"He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but\nhe that seeketh the glory of Him that sent him, the same is true, and no\nunrighteousness is in him.\" \u00a0John 7:18, R. V. He that seeketh his own\nglory is speaking only from himself. The spirit of self-seeking betrays\nits origin. But Christ was seeking the glory of God. He spoke the words\nof God. This was the evidence of His authority as a teacher of the\ntruth. \u00a0{DA 456.1}",
                "Jesus gave the rabbis an evidence of His divinity by showing that He\nread their hearts. Ever since the healing at Bethesda they had been\nplotting His death. Thus they were themselves breaking the law which\nthey professed to be defending. \"Did not Moses give you the law,\" He\nsaid, \"and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill\nMe?\" \u00a0{DA 456.2}",
                "Like a swift flash of light these words revealed to the rabbis the pit\nof ruin into which they were about to plunge. For an instant they were\nfilled with terror. They saw that they were in conflict with Infinite\nPower. But they would not be warned. In order to maintain their\ninfluence with the people, their murderous designs must be concealed.\nEvading the question of Jesus, they exclaimed, \"Thou hast a devil: who\ngoeth about to kill Thee?\" They insinuated that the wonderful works of\nJesus were instigated by an evil spirit. \u00a0{DA 456.3}",
                "To this insinuation Christ gave no heed. He went on to show that His\nwork of healing at Bethesda was in harmony with the Sabbath law, and\nthat it was justified by the interpretation which the Jews themselves\nput upon the law. He said, \"Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision;\n\\... and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man.\" According to the law,\nevery child must be circumcised on the eighth day. Should the appointed\ntime fall upon the Sabbath, the rite must then be performed. How much\nmore must it be in harmony with the \u00a0spirit of the law to make a man\n\"every whit whole on the Sabbath day.\" And He warned them to \"judge not\naccording to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.\" \u00a0{DA 456.4}",

The conviction pressed upon them\nthat He was the Son of God. But Satan was ready to suggest doubt; and\nfor this the way was prepared by their own erroneous ideas of the\nMessiah and His coming. It was generally believed that Christ would be\nborn at Bethlehem, but that after a time He would disappear, and at His\nsecond appearance none would know whence He came. There were not a few\nwho held that the Messiah would have no natural relationship to\nhumanity. And because the popular conception of the glory of the Messiah\nwas not met by Jesus of Nazareth, many gave heed to the suggestion,\n\"Howbeit we know this Man whence He is: but when Christ cometh, no man\nknoweth whence He is.\" \u00a0{DA 457.2}",
                "While they were thus wavering between doubt and faith, Jesus took up\ntheir thoughts and answered them: \"Ye both know Me, and ye know whence I\nam: and I am not come of Myself, but He that sent Me is true, whom ye\nknow not.\" They claimed a knowledge of what the origin of Christ should\nbe, but they were in utter ignorance of it. If they had lived in\naccordance with the will of God, they would have known His Son when He\nwas manifested to them. \u00a0{DA 457.3}",
                "The hearers could not but understand Christ's words. Clearly they were a\nrepetition of the claim He had made in the presence of the Sanhedrin\nmany months before, when He declared Himself the Son of God. As the\nrulers then tried to compass His death, so now they sought to take Him;\nbut they were prevented by an unseen power, which put a limit to their\nrage, saying to them, Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther. \u00a0{DA 457.4}",

Hurrying\naway to the chief priests, they laid their plans to arrest Him. \u00a0They\narranged, however, to take Him when He was alone; for they dared not\nseize Him in the presence of the people. Again Jesus made it manifest\nthat He read their purpose. \"Yet a little while am I with you,\" He said,\n\"and then I go unto Him that sent Me. Ye shall seek Me, and shall not\nfind Me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.\" Soon He would find a\nrefuge beyond the reach of their scorn and hate.

All day long He had\nstretched forth His hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people; yet\nHe would be found of them that sought Him not; among a people that had\nnot called upon His name He would be manifest. \u00a0Romans 10:20, 21. \u00a0{DA\n458.1}",

God designs that men shall not decide from impulse, but\nfrom weight of evidence, carefully comparing scripture with scripture.\nHad the Jews laid by their prejudice and compared written prophecy with\nthe facts characterizing the life of Jesus, they would have perceived a\nbeautiful harmony between the prophecies and their fulfillment in the\nlife and ministry of the lowly Galilean. \u00a0{DA 458.3}",

This commission His teaching had prepared them to\nfulfill. When in their Master's name they went to Samaria, they found\nthe people ready to receive them. The Samaritans had heard of Christ's\nwords of commendation and His works of mercy for men of their nation.\nThey saw that, notwithstanding their rude treatment of Him, He had only\nthoughts of love toward them, and their hearts were won.

He\nfound us ready to die, and He undertook our case. He healed our wounds.\nHe covered us with His robe of righteousness.

Christ bade the lawyer, \"Go, and do thou likewise.\" Doing, and not\nsaying merely, is expected of the children of God. \"He that saith he\nabideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\" \u00a01 John\n2:6. \u00a0{DA 504.1}",

They look upon their mistakes and errors, until\nthey are driven almost to desperation. These souls we are not to\nneglect. If we are Christians, we shall not pass by on the other side,\nkeeping as far as possible from the very ones who most need our help.\nWhen we see human beings in distress, whether through affliction or\nthrough sin, we shall never say, This does not concern me. \u00a0{DA 504.3}",

In a\nmarked degree the ruler could have represented Christ; for he possessed\nqualifications, which, if he were united with the Saviour, would enable\nhim to become a divine force among men.

God has set His own standard of character for all who would\nbecome subjects of His kingdom. Only those who will become co-workers\nwith Christ, only those who will say, Lord, all I have and all I am is\nThine, will be acknowledged as sons and daughters of God.

The\nSaviour blessed all who sought His help; He loves all the human family,\nbut to some He is bound by peculiarly tender associations.

Here He found a sincere welcome,\nand pure, holy friendship. Here He could speak with simplicity and\nperfect freedom, knowing that His words would be understood and\ntreasured. \u00a0{DA 524.2}",

He sought to open the eyes of\ntheir understanding, that they might see how the hand of God upholds the\nworld. In order to call out an appreciation of God's goodness and\nbenevolence, He called the attention of His hearers to the gently\nfalling dew, to the soft showers of rain and the bright sunshine, given\nalike to good and evil. He desired men to realize more fully the regard\nthat God bestows on the human instrumentalities He has created. But the\nmultitudes were slow of hearing, and in the home at Bethany Christ found\nrest from the weary conflict of public life. Here He opened to an\nappreciative audience the volume of Providence.

The\nSaviour and His disciples had just made the toilsome journey on foot\nfrom Jericho. Martha was anxious to provide for their comfort, and in\nher anxiety she forgot the courtesy due to her Guest.

There is a wide field\nfor the Marthas, with their zeal in active religious work. But let them\nfirst sit with Mary at the feet of Jesus.

Possessing such power, why did not\nChrist save John's life? This question had often been asked by the\nPharisees, who presented it as an unanswerable argument against Christ's\nclaim to be the Son of God.

They had been tempted to think that He had not the tender love\nfor Lazarus and his sisters that they had thought He had, or He would\nhave hastened back with the messenger.

He permitted Lazarus to pass under the\ndominion of death; and the suffering sisters saw their brother laid in\nthe grave.

Then the righteous dead shall be raised incorruptible,\nand the living righteous shall be translated to heaven without seeing\ndeath. The miracle which Christ was about to perform, in raising Lazarus\nfrom the dead, would represent the resurrection of all the righteous\ndead. By His word and His works He declared Himself the Author of the\nresurrection. He who Himself was soon to die upon the cross stood with\nthe keys of death, a conqueror of the grave, and asserted His right and\npower to give eternal life. \u00a0{DA 530.3}",

When she reached the place where Jesus was\nwaiting, she knelt at His feet, and said with quivering lips, \"Lord, if\nThou hadst been here, my brother had not died.\" The cries of the\nmourners were painful to her; for she longed for a few quiet words alone\nwith Jesus.

He knew that some in the\ncompany, now manifesting hypocritical sorrow, would erelong be planning\nthe death, not only of the mighty miracle worker, but of the one to be\nraised from the dead. Christ could have stripped from them their robe of\npretended sorrow. But He restrained His righteous indignation.

In view of this human\ndistress, and of the fact that the afflicted friends could mourn over\nthe dead while the Saviour of the world stood by,---\"Jesus wept.\" Though\nHe was the Son of God, yet He had taken human nature upon Him, and He\nwas moved by human sorrow. His tender, pitying heart is ever awakened to\nsympathy by suffering. He weeps with those that weep, and rejoices with\nthose that rejoice. \u00a0{DA 533.3}",
                "But it was not only because of His human sympathy with Mary and Martha\nthat Jesus wept. In His tears there was a sorrow as high above human\nsorrow as the heavens are higher than the earth. Christ did not weep for\nLazarus; for He was about to call him from the grave. He wept because\nmany of those now mourning for Lazarus would soon plan the death of Him\nwho was the resurrection and the life. But how unable were the\nunbelieving Jews rightly to interpret His tears! Some, who \u00a0could see\nnothing more than the outward circumstances of the scene before Him as a\ncause for His grief, said softly, \"Behold how He loved him!\" Others,\nseeking to drop the seed of unbelief into the hearts of those present,\nsaid derisively, \"Could not this Man, which opened the eyes of the\nblind, have caused that even this man should not have died?\" If it were\nin Christ's power to save Lazarus, why then did He suffer him to\ndie? \u00a0{DA 533.4}",

A scene\nwas about to take place, in His humiliation and crucifixion, that would\nresult in the destruction of Jerusalem, and at that time none would make\nlamentation for the dead. The retribution that was coming upon Jerusalem\nwas plainly portrayed before Him. He saw Jerusalem compassed by the\nRoman legions.

                "It was not only because of the scene before Him that Christ wept. The\nweight of the grief of ages was upon Him. He saw the terrible effects of\nthe transgression of God's law. He saw that in the history of the world,\nbeginning with the death of Abel, the conflict between good and evil had\nbeen unceasing. Looking down the years to come, He saw the suffering and\nsorrow, tears and death, that were to be the lot of men. His heart was\npierced with the pain of the human family of all ages and in all lands.\nThe woes of the sinful race were heavy upon His soul, and the fountain\nof His tears was broken up as He longed to relieve all their\ndistress. \u00a0{DA 534.2}",

Thinking\nthat He only wished to look upon the dead, Martha objected, saying that\nthe body had been buried four days, and corruption had already begun its\nwork. This statement, made before the raising of Lazarus, left no room\nfor Christ's enemies to say that a deception had been practiced. In the\npast the Pharisees had circulated false statements regarding the most\nwonderful manifestations of the power of God. When Christ raised to life\nthe daughter of Jairus, He had said, \"The damsel is not dead, but\nsleepeth.\" \u00a0Mark 5:39. As she had been sick only \u00a0a short time, and was\nraised immediately after death, the Pharisees declared that the child\nhad not been dead; that Christ Himself had said she was only asleep.\nThey had tried to make it appear that Christ could not cure disease,\nthat there was foul play about His miracles. But in this case, none\ncould deny that Lazarus was dead. \u00a0{DA 534.3}",
                "When the Lord is about to do a work, Satan moves upon someone to object.\n\"Take ye away the stone,\" Christ said. As far as possible, prepare the\nway for My work. But Martha's positive and ambitious nature asserted\nitself. She was unwilling that the decomposing body should be brought to\nview. The human heart is slow to understand Christ's words, and Martha's\nfaith had not grasped the true meaning of His promise. \u00a0{DA 535.1}",
                "Christ reproved Martha, but His words were spoken with the utmost\ngentleness. \"Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou\nshouldest see the glory of God?\" Why should you doubt in regard to My\npower? Why reason in opposition to My requirements? You have My word. If\nyou will believe, you shall see the glory of God. Natural\nimpossibilities cannot prevent the work of the Omnipotent One.\nSkepticism and unbelief are not humility. Implicit belief in Christ's\nword is true humility, true self-surrender. \u00a0{DA 535.2}",
                "\"Take \u00a0*ye* \u00a0away the stone.\" Christ could have commanded the stone to\nremove, and it would have obeyed His voice. He could have bidden the\nangels who were close by His side to do this. At His bidding, invisible\nhands would have removed the stone. But it was to be taken away by human\nhands. Thus Christ would show that humanity is to co-operate with\ndivinity. What human power can do divine power is not summoned to do.\nGod does not dispense with man's aid. He strengthens him, co-operating\nwith him as he uses the powers and capabilities given him. \u00a0{DA 535.3}",

Ever He had\nbeen careful to make it evident that He did not work independently; it\nwas by faith and prayer that He wrought His miracles. Christ desired all\nto know His relationship with His Father. \"Father,\" He said, \"I thank\nThee that Thou hast heard Me. And I knew that Thou hearest Me always:\nbut because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may\nbelieve that Thou hast sent Me.\" Here the disciples and the people were\nto be given the most convincing evidence in regard to the relationship\nexisting between Christ and God.

                "\"And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come\nforth.\" His voice, clear and penetrating, pierces the ear of the dead.\nAs He speaks, divinity flashes through humanity. In His face, which is\nlighted up by the glory of God, the people see the assurance of His\npower. Every eye is fastened on the entrance to the cave. Every ear is\nbent to catch the slightest sound.

Humanity is to work for humanity. Lazarus is\nset free, and stands before the company, not as one emaciated from\ndisease, and with feeble, tottering limbs, but as a man in the prime of\nlife, and in the vigor of a noble manhood.

Through spies who had witnessed the\nmiracle the Jewish rulers were speedily in possession of the facts. A\nmeeting of the Sanhedrin was at once called to decide as to what should\nbe done. Christ had now fully made manifest His control of death and the\ngrave. That mighty miracle was the crowning evidence offered by God to\nmen that He had sent His Son into the world for their salvation. It was\na demonstration of divine power sufficient to convince every mind that\nwas under the control of reason and enlightened conscience. Many who\nwitnessed the resurrection of Lazarus were led to believe on Jesus. But\nthe hatred of the priests against Him was intensified. They had rejected\nall lesser evidence of His divinity, and they were only enraged at this\nnew miracle. The dead had been raised in the full light of day, and\nbefore a crowd of witnesses. No artifice could explain away such\nevidence. For this very reason the enmity of the priests grew deadlier.\nThey were more than ever determined to put a stop to Christ's work. \u00a0{DA\n537.1}",

Producing so-called science, they had reasoned\nthat it would be an impossibility for a dead body to be brought to life.\nBut by a few words from Christ their theory had been overthrown. They\nwere shown to be ignorant both of the Scriptures and of the power of\nGod. They could see no possibility of removing the impression made on\nthe people by the miracle. How could men be turned away from Him who had\nprevailed to rob the grave of its dead? Lying reports were put in\ncirculation, but the miracle could not be denied, and how to counteract\nits effect they knew not. Thus far the Sadducees had not encouraged the\nplan of putting Christ to death. But after the resurrection of Lazarus\nthey decided that only by His death could His fearless denunciations\nagainst them be stopped. \u00a0{DA 537.2}",

The pure religion that He taught had condemned their hollow\nprofessions of piety. They thirsted to be revenged upon Him for His\npointed rebukes. They had tried to provoke Him to say or do something\nthat would give them occasion to condemn Him.

To excite the Romans against Him, they had\nrepresented Him as trying to subvert their authority. They had tried\nevery pretext to cut Him off from influencing the people. But so far\ntheir attempts had been foiled. The multitudes who witnessed His works\nof mercy and heard His pure and holy teachings knew that these were not\nthe deeds and words of a Sabbathbreaker or blasphemer.

Nicodemus and Joseph had, in former\ncouncils, prevented the condemnation of Jesus, and for this reason they\nwere not now summoned.

The Sadducees were united in their\nhatred of Christ, yet they were inclined to be cautious in their\nmovements, fearing that the Romans would deprive them of their high\nstanding. \u00a0{DA 539.1}",

Events in the life\nof Christ rose up before them with a distinctness that alarmed them.\nThey remembered the scene in the temple, when Jesus, then a child of\ntwelve, stood before the learned doctors of the law, asking them\nquestions at which they wondered. The miracle just performed bore\nwitness that Jesus was none other than the Son of God. In their true\nsignificance, the Old Testament Scriptures regarding Christ flashed\nbefore their minds. Perplexed and troubled, the rulers asked, \"What do\nwe?\" There was a division in the council.

Among his family connections were Sadducees, proud, bold,\nreckless, full of ambition and cruelty, which they hid under a cloak of\npretended righteousness. Caiaphas had studied the prophecies, and\nalthough ignorant of their true meaning, he spoke with great authority\nand assurance: \"Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is\nexpedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the\nwhole nation \u00a0perish not.\" Even if Jesus were innocent, urged the high\npriest, He must be put out of the way. He was troublesome, drawing the\npeople to Himself, and lessening the authority of the rulers. He was\nonly one; it was better that He should die than that the authority of\nthe rulers should be weakened. If the people were to lose confidence in\ntheir rulers, the national power would be destroyed. Caiaphas urged that\nafter this miracle the followers of Jesus would likely rise in revolt.\nThe Romans will then come, he said, and will close our temple, and\nabolish our laws, destroying us as a nation. What is the life of this\nGalilean worth in comparison with the life of the nation? If He stands\nin the way of Israel's well-being, is it not doing God a service to\nremove Him?

So\nCaiaphas proposed by the sacrifice of Jesus to save the guilty nation,\nnot from transgression, but in transgression, that they might continue\nin sin. And by his reasoning he thought to silence the remonstrances of\nthose who might dare to say that as yet nothing worthy of death had been\nfound in Jesus. \u00a0{DA 540.2}",

Taking no notice of their forms and ceremonies, He\nhad encouraged sinners to go directly to God as a merciful Father, and\nmake known their wants. Thus, in their opinion, He had set aside the\npriesthood. He had refused to acknowledge the theology of the rabbinical\nschools. He had exposed the evil practices of the priests, \u00a0and had\nirreparably hurt their influence.

They\nresolved to put Christ to death at the first favorable opportunity. In\nrejecting the proof of the divinity of Jesus, these priests and rulers\nhad locked themselves in impenetrable darkness. They had come wholly\nunder the sway of Satan, to be hurried by him over the brink of eternal\nruin. Yet such was their deception that they were well pleased with\nthemselves.

He knew that they longed to remove Him, and\nthat their purpose would soon be accomplished. But it was not His place\nto hasten the crisis, and He withdrew from that region, taking the\ndisciples with Him. Thus by His own example Jesus again enforced the\ninstruction He had given to the disciples, \"When they persecute you in\nthis city, flee ye into another.\" \u00a0Matthew 10:23.

His rank and wealth were the reward of a calling \u00a0they\nabhorred, and which was regarded as another name for injustice and\nextortion. Yet the wealthy customs officer was not altogether the\nhardened man of the world that he seemed. Beneath the appearance of\nworldliness and pride was a heart susceptible to divine influences.\nZacchaeus had heard of Jesus. The report of One who had borne Himself\nwith kindness and courtesy toward the proscribed classes had spread far\nand wide. In this chief of the publicans was awakened a longing for a\nbetter life. Only a few miles from Jericho, John the Baptist had\npreached at the Jordan, and Zacchaeus had heard of the call to\nrepentance. The instruction to the publicans, \"Exact no more than that\nwhich is appointed you\" (Luke 3:13), though outwardly disregarded, had\nimpressed his mind. He knew the Scriptures, and was convicted that his\npractice was wrong. Now, hearing the words reported to have come from\nthe Great Teacher, he felt that he was a sinner in the sight of God. Yet\nwhat he had heard of Jesus kindled hope in his heart. Repentance,\nreformation of life, was possible, even to him; was not one of the new\nTeacher's most trusted disciples a publican?

Had Mary's ointment been sold, and the proceeds fallen into his\npossession, the poor would have received no benefit. \u00a0{DA 559.2}",
                "Judas had a high opinion of his own executive ability. As a financier he\nthought himself greatly superior to his fellow disciples, and he had led\nthem to regard him in the same light. He had gained their confidence,\nand had a strong influence over them. His professed sympathy for the\npoor deceived them, and his artful insinuation caused them to\nlook \u00a0distrustfully upon Mary's devotion. The murmur passed round the\ntable, \"To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been\nsold for much, and given to the poor.\" \u00a0{DA 559.3}",
                "Mary heard the words of criticism. Her heart trembled within her. She\nfeared that her sister would reproach her for extravagance. The Master,\ntoo, might think her improvident. Without apology or excuse she was\nabout to shrink away, when the voice of her Lord was heard, \"Let her\nalone; why trouble ye her?\" He saw that she was embarrassed and\ndistressed. He knew that in this act of service she had expressed her\ngratitude for the forgiveness of her sins, and He brought relief to her\nmind. Lifting His voice above the murmur of criticism, He said, \"She\nhath wrought a good work on Me. For ye have the poor with you always,\nand whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but Me ye have not always.\nShe hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint My body to\nthe burying.\" \u00a0{DA 560.1}",
                "The fragrant gift which Mary had thought to lavish upon the dead body of\nthe Saviour she poured upon His living form. At the burial its sweetness\ncould only have pervaded the tomb; now it gladdened His heart with the\nassurance of her faith and love. Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus\noffered not their gift of love to Jesus in His life. With bitter tears\nthey brought their costly spices for His cold, unconscious form. The\nwomen who bore spices to the tomb found their errand in vain, for He had\nrisen. But Mary, pouring out her love upon the Saviour while He was\nconscious of her devotion, was anointing Him for the burial. And as He\nwent down into the darkness of His great trial, He carried with Him the\nmemory of that deed, an earnest of the love that would be His from His\nredeemed ones forever. \u00a0{DA 560.2}",
                "Many there are who bring their precious gifts for the dead. As they\nstand about the cold, silent form, words of love are freely spoken.\nTenderness, appreciation, devotion, all are lavished upon one who sees\nnot nor hears. Had these words been spoken when the weary spirit needed\nthem so much, when the ear could hear and the heart could feel, how\nprecious would have been their fragrance! \u00a0{DA 560.3}",
                "Mary knew not the full significance of her deed of love. She could not\nanswer her accusers. She could not explain why she had chosen that\noccasion for anointing Jesus. The Holy Spirit had planned for her, and\nshe had obeyed His promptings. Inspiration stoops to give no reason. An\nunseen presence, it speaks to mind and soul, and moves the heart to\naction. It is its own justification. \u00a0{DA 560.4}",
                "Christ told Mary the meaning of her act, and in this He gave her \u00a0more\nthan He had received. \"In that she hath poured this ointment on My\nbody,\" He said, \"she did it for My burial.\" As the alabaster box was\nbroken, and filled the whole house with its fragrance, so Christ was to\ndie, His body was to be broken; but He was to rise from the tomb, and\nthe fragrance of His life was to fill the earth.

                "\"Verily I say unto you,\" Christ declared, \"Wheresoever this gospel shall\nbe preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done\nshall be spoken of for a memorial of her.\" Looking into the future, the\nSaviour spoke with certainty concerning His gospel. It was to be\npreached throughout the world. And as far as the gospel extended, Mary's\ngift would shed its fragrance, and hearts would be blessed through her\nunstudied act. Kingdoms would rise and fall; the names of monarchs and\nconquerors would be forgotten; but this woman's deed would be\nimmortalized upon the pages of sacred history. Until time should be no\nmore, that broken alabaster box would tell the story of the abundant\nlove of God for a fallen race. \u00a0{DA 563.1}",
                "Mary's act was in marked contrast with that which Judas was about to do.\nWhat a sharp lesson Christ might have given him who had dropped the seed\nof criticism and evil thinking into the minds of the disciples! How\njustly the accuser might have been accused! He who reads the motives of\nevery heart, and understands every action, might have opened before\nthose at the feast dark chapters in the experience of Judas. The hollow\npretense on which the traitor based his words might have been laid bare;\nfor, instead of sympathizing with the poor, he was robbing them of the\nmoney intended for their relief. Indignation might have been excited\nagainst him for his oppression of the widow, the orphan, and the\nhireling. But had Christ unmasked Judas, this would have been urged as a\nreason for the betrayal. And though charged with being a thief, Judas\nwould have gained sympathy, even among the disciples. The Saviour\nreproached him not, and thus avoided giving him an excuse for his\ntreachery. \u00a0{DA 563.2}",
                "But the look which Jesus cast upon Judas convinced him that the Saviour\npenetrated his hypocrisy, and read his base, contemptible character.

Now the reproof rankled in his heart. He determined to\nbe revenged. From the supper he went directly to \u00a0the palace of the high\npriest, where he found the council assembled, and he offered to betray\nJesus into their hands. \u00a0{DA 563.3}",

The wise men from the East, who knew so little of Jesus, had\nshown a truer appreciation of the honor due Him.

He accepted the offerings of children, and blessed the givers,\ninscribing their names in the book of life. In the Scriptures, Mary's\nanointing of Jesus is mentioned as distinguishing her from the other\nMarys. Acts of love and reverence for Jesus are an evidence of faith in\nHim as the Son of God.

The loneliness of Christ,\nseparated from the heavenly courts, living the life of humanity, was\nnever understood or appreciated by the disciples as it should have been.\nHe was often grieved because His disciples did not give Him that which\nHe should have received from them.

They no longer cast blame upon Mary, but upon themselves. Oh,\nif they could have taken back their censuring, their presenting the poor\nas more worthy of the gift than was Christ!

From a\nhuman point of view, such a sacrifice was a wanton waste. To human\nreasoning the whole plan of salvation is a waste of mercies and\nresources.

Jesus did not design to teach that\ndifferent degrees of obligation should be felt by the \u00a0two persons, for\neach owed a debt of gratitude that never could be repaid. But Simon felt\nhimself more righteous than Mary, and Jesus desired him to see how great\nhis guilt really was.

There were the captives whom He had rescued from Satan's\npower, praising God for their deliverance. The blind whom He had\nrestored to sight were leading the way. The dumb whose tongues He had\nloosed shouted the loudest hosannas. The cripples whom He had healed\nbounded with joy, and were the most active in breaking the palm branches\nand waving them before the Saviour. Widows and orphans were exalting the\nname of Jesus for His works of mercy to them. The lepers whom He had\ncleansed spread their untainted garments in His path, and hailed Him as\nthe King of glory.

The temple attracted all eyes. In stately grandeur it\ntowered above all else, seeming to point toward heaven as if directing\nthe people to the only true and living God. The temple had long been the\npride and glory of the Jewish nation. The Romans also prided themselves\nin its magnificence.

This design\nrepresented Israel as a prosperous vine. The gold, silver, and living\ngreen were combined with rare taste and exquisite workmanship; as it\ntwined gracefully about the white and glistening pillars, clinging with\nshining tendrils to their golden ornaments, it caught the splendor of\nthe setting sun, shining as if with a glory borrowed from heaven. \u00a0{DA\n575.2}",

He saw that the\nstubbornness of the Jews, as evinced in their rejection of His\nsalvation, would also lead them to refuse submission to the invading\narmies.

Bible truth, the religion of Christ, struggles\nagainst a strong current of moral impurity. Prejudice is even stronger\nin the hearts of men now than in Christ's day. Christ did not fulfill\nmen's expectations; His life was a rebuke to their sins, and they\nrejected Him. So now the truth of God's word does not harmonize with\nmen's practices and their natural inclination, and thousands reject its\nlight. Men prompted by Satan cast doubt upon God's word, and choose to\nexercise \u00a0their independent judgment. They choose darkness rather than\nlight, but they do it at the peril of their souls. Those who caviled at\nthe words of Christ, found ever-increased cause for cavil, until they\nturned from the Truth and the Life. So it is now. God does not propose\nto remove every objection which the carnal heart may bring against His\ntruth. To those who refuse the precious rays of light which would\nilluminate the darkness, the mysteries of God's word remain such\nforever. From them the truth is hidden.

The outer court of the temple was like a vast cattle yard. With\nthe cries of the animals and the sharp chinking of coin was mingled the\nsound of angry altercation between traffickers, and among them were\nheard the voices of men in sacred office. The dignitaries of the temple\nwere themselves engaged in buying and selling and the exchange of money.\nSo completely were they controlled by their greed of gain that in the\nsight of God they were no better than thieves. \u00a0{DA 589.1}",

At every Passover and Feast of\nTabernacles, thousands of animals were slain, and their blood was caught\nby the priests and poured upon the altar. The Jews had become familiar\nwith the offering of blood, and had almost lost sight of the fact that\nit was sin which made necessary all this shedding of the blood of\nbeasts. They did not discern that it prefigured the blood of God's dear\nSon, \u00a0which was to be shed for the life of the world, and that by the\noffering of sacrifices men were to be directed to a crucified\nRedeemer. \u00a0{DA 589.2}",

The\npriests and rulers had hardened their hearts through selfishness and\navarice. The very symbols pointing to the Lamb of God they had made a\nmeans of getting gain. Thus in the eyes of the people the sacredness of\nthe sacrificial service had been in a great measure destroyed. The\nindignation of Jesus was stirred; He knew that His blood, so soon to be\nshed for the sins of the world, would be as little appreciated by the\npriests and elders as was the blood of beasts which they kept\nincessantly flowing. \u00a0{DA 590.1}",

Upon entering, they stood transfixed\nbefore the wonderful scene. They saw the sick healed, the blind restored\nto sight, and deaf receive their hearing, and the crippled leap for joy.\nThe children were foremost in the rejoicing. Jesus had healed their\nmaladies; He had clasped them in His arms, received their kisses of\ngrateful affection, and some of them had fallen asleep upon His breast\nas He was teaching the people.

And Jesus saith unto\nthem, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and\nsucklings \u00a0Thou hast perfected praise?\" Prophecy had foretold that Christ\nshould be proclaimed as king, and that word must be fulfilled.

He had done marvelous works throughout Jerusalem, but never\nbefore in a manner so solemn and impressive.

He had\nrepeatedly read the hearts of men as an open book; He had cast out\ndemons, and raised the dead. The rulers had before them the evidences of\nHis Messiahship.

Such an assertion they intended to deny. But Jesus met them\nwith a question apparently pertaining to another subject, and He made\nHis reply to them conditional on their answering this question. \"The\nbaptism of John,\" He said, \"whence was it? from heaven, or of men?\" \u00a0{DA\n593.3}",

If the\npriests believed John's testimony, how could they deny the Messiahship\nof Christ?

They knew that\nthe priests had professed to accept the ministry of John, and they\nexpected them to acknowledge without a question that he was sent from\nGod.

Hypocritically professing ignorance, they said, \"We\ncannot tell.\" \"Neither tell I you,\" said Christ, \"by what authority I do\nthese things.\" \u00a0{DA 594.1}",
                "Scribes, priests, and rulers were all silenced. Baffled and\ndisappointed, they stood with lowering brows, not daring to press\nfurther questions upon Christ.

                "All these sayings and doings of Christ were important, and their\ninfluence was to be felt in an ever-increasing degree after His\ncrucifixion and ascension. Many of those who had anxiously awaited the\nresult of the questioning of Jesus were finally to become His disciples,\nfirst drawn toward Him by His words on that eventful day. The scene in\nthe temple court was never to fade from their minds. The contrast\nbetween Jesus and the high priest as they talked together was marked.\nThe proud dignitary of the temple was clothed in rich and costly\ngarments. Upon his head was a glittering tiara. His bearing was\nmajestic, his hair and his long flowing beard were silvered by age. His\nappearance awed the beholders. Before this august personage stood the\nMajesty of heaven, without adornment or display. His garments were\ntravel stained; His face was pale, and expressed a patient sadness; yet\nwritten there were dignity and benevolence that contrasted strangely\nwith the proud, self-confident, and angry air of the high priest. Many\nof those who witnessed the words and deeds of Jesus in the temple from\nthat time enshrined Him in their hearts as a prophet of God. But as the\npopular feeling turned in His favor, the hatred of the priests toward\nJesus increased.

In the parable the householder\nrepresented God, the vineyard the Jewish nation, and the hedge the\ndivine law which was their protection. The tower was a symbol of the\ntemple. The lord of the vineyard had done everything needful for its\nprosperity. \"What could have been done more to my vineyard,\" he says,\n\"that I have not done in it?\" \u00a0Isaiah 5:4. Thus was represented God's\nunwearied care for Israel. And as the husbandmen were to return to the\nlord a due proportion of the fruits of the vineyard, so God's people\nwere to honor Him by a life corresponding to their sacred privileges.\nBut as the husbandmen had killed the servants whom the master sent to\nthem for fruit, so the Jews had put to death the prophets whom God sent\nto call them to repentance. Messenger after messenger had been slain.\nThus far the application of the parable could not be questioned, and in\nwhat followed it was not less evident. In the beloved son whom the lord\nof the vineyard finally sent to his disobedient servants, and whom\nthey \u00a0seized and slew, the priests and rulers saw a distinct picture of\nJesus and His impending fate. Already they were planning to slay Him\nwhom the Father had sent to them as a last appeal. In the retribution\ninflicted upon the ungrateful husbandmen was portrayed the doom of those\nwho should put Christ to death. \u00a0{DA 596.3}",

While it had a special\napplication at the time of Christ's first advent, and should have\nappealed with special force to the Jews, it has also a lesson for us.\nWhen the temple of Solomon \u00a0was erected, the immense stones for the walls\nand the foundation were entirely prepared at the quarry; after they were\nbrought to the place of building, not an instrument was to be used upon\nthem; the workmen had only to place them in position. For use in the\nfoundation, one stone of unusual size and peculiar shape had been\nbrought; but the workmen could find no place for it, and would not\naccept it. It was an annoyance to them as it lay unused in their way.\nLong it remained a rejected stone. But when the builders came to the\nlaying of the corner, they searched for a long time to find a stone of\nsufficient size and strength, and of the proper shape, to take that\nparticular place, and bear the great weight which would rest upon it.\nShould they make an unwise choice for this important place, the safety\nof the entire building would be endangered. They must find a stone\ncapable of resisting the influence of the sun, of frost, and of tempest.\nSeveral stones had at different times been chosen, but under the\npressure of immense weights they had crumbled to pieces. Others could\nnot bear the test of the sudden atmospheric changes. But at last\nattention was called to the stone so long rejected. It had been exposed\nto the air, to sun and storm, without revealing the slightest crack. The\nbuilders examined this stone. It had borne every test but one. If it\ncould bear the test of severe pressure, they decided to accept it for\nthe cornerstone. The trial was made. The stone was accepted, brought to\nits assigned position, and found to be an exact fit. In prophetic\nvision, Isaiah was shown that this stone was a symbol of Christ. He\nsays: \u00a0{DA 597.5}",

And many among them\nshall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.\"\nCarried down in prophetic vision to the first advent, the prophet is\nshown that Christ is to bear trials and tests of which the treatment of\nthe chief cornerstone in the temple of Solomon was symbolic. \"Therefore\nthus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone,\na tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation: he that\nbelieveth shall not make haste.\" \u00a0Isaiah 8:13-15; \u00a028:16. \u00a0{DA 598.1}",

It was\nthe goodness of God despised, the righteousness spurned, the mercy\nslighted. Men set themselves in opposition to God, and all that would\nhave been their salvation was turned to their destruction. All that God\nordained unto life they found to be unto death.

                "\"The scribes and the Pharisees,\" He said, \"sit in Moses' seat: all\ntherefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do\nnot ye after their works: for they say, and do not.\" The scribes and\nPharisees claimed to be invested with divine authority similar to that\nof Moses. They assumed to take his place as expounders of the law and\njudges of the people. As such they claimed from the people the utmost\ndeference and obedience. Jesus bade His hearers do that which the rabbis\ntaught according to the law, but not to follow their example. They\nthemselves did not practice their own teaching. \u00a0{DA 612.1}",
                "And they taught much that was contrary to the Scriptures. Jesus said,\n\"They bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's\nshoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their\nfingers.\" The Pharisees enjoined a multitude of regulations, having\ntheir foundation in tradition, and unreasonably restricting personal\nliberty. And certain portions of the law they so explained as to impose\nupon the people observances which they themselves secretly ignored, and\nfrom which, when it served their purpose, they actually claimed\nexemption. \u00a0{DA 612.2}",
                "To make a show of their piety was their constant aim. Nothing was held\ntoo sacred to serve this end. To Moses God had said concerning His\ncommandments, \"Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they\nshall be as frontlets between thine eyes.\" \u00a0Deuteronomy 6:8. These words\nhave a deep meaning. As the word of God is meditated upon and practiced,\nthe whole man will be ennobled. In righteous and merciful dealing, the\nhands will reveal, as a signet, the principles of God's law. They will\nbe kept clean from bribes, and from all that is corrupt and deceptive.\nThey will be active in works of love and compassion. The eyes, directed\ntoward a noble purpose, will be clear and true. The expressive\ncountenance, the speaking eye, will testify to the blameless character\nof him who loves and honors the word of God. But by the Jews of Christ's\nday all this was undiscerned. The command given to Moses was construed\ninto a direction that the precepts of Scripture should be worn upon the\nperson. They were accordingly written upon strips of parchment, and\nbound in a conspicuous manner about the head and wrists. But this did\nnot cause the law of God to take a firmer hold of the mind and heart.\nThese parchments were worn merely as badges, \u00a0to attract attention. They\nwere thought to give the wearers an air of devotion which would command\nthe reverence of the people. Jesus struck a blow at this vain\npretense: \u00a0{DA 612.3}",
                "\"But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad\ntheir phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love\nthe uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,\nand greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. But\nbe not ye called Rabbi: for One is your Master, even Christ; and all ye\nare brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for One is\nyour Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye called master: for One is\nyour Master, even Christ.\" In such plain words the Saviour revealed the\nselfish ambition that was ever reaching for place and power, displaying\na mock humility, while the heart was filled with avarice and envy. When\npersons were invited to a feast, the guests were seated according to\ntheir rank, and those who were given the most honorable place received\nthe first attention and special favors. The Pharisees were ever scheming\nto secure these honors. This practice Jesus rebuked. \u00a0{DA 613.1}",
                "He also reproved the vanity shown in coveting the title of rabbi, or\nmaster. Such a title, He declared, belonged not to men, but to Christ.\nPriests, scribes, and rulers, expounders and administrators of the law,\nwere all brethren, children of one Father. Jesus impressed upon the\npeople that they were to give no man a title of honor indicating his\ncontrol of their conscience or their faith. \u00a0{DA 613.2}",
                "If Christ were on earth today, surrounded by those who bear the title of\n\"Reverend\" or \"Right Reverend,\" would He not repeat His saying, \"Neither\nbe ye called masters: for One is your Master, even Christ\"? The\nScripture declares of God, \"Holy and reverend is His name.\" \u00a0Psalm 111:9.\nTo what human being is such a title befitting? How little does man\nreveal of the wisdom and righteousness it indicates! How many of those\nwho assume this title are misrepresenting the name and character of God!\nAlas, how often have worldly ambition, despotism, and the basest sins\nbeen hidden under the broidered garments of a high and holy office! The\nSaviour continued: \u00a0{DA 613.3}",
                "\"But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whosoever\nshall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself\nshall be exalted.\" Again and again Christ had taught that true greatness\nis measured by moral worth. In the estimation of heaven, greatness of\ncharacter consists in living for the welfare of our fellow men, in \u00a0doing\nworks of love and mercy. Christ the King of glory was a servant to\nfallen man. \u00a0{DA 613.4}",
                "\"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,\" said Jesus; \"for ye\nshut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in\nyourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.\" By\nperverting the Scriptures, the priests and lawyers blinded the minds of\nthose who would otherwise have received a knowledge of Christ's kingdom,\nand that inward, divine life which is essential to true holiness. \u00a0{DA\n614.1}",
                "\"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows'\nhouses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive\nthe greater damnation.\" The Pharisees had great influence with the\npeople, and of this they took advantage to serve their own interests.\nThey gained the confidence of pious widows, and then represented it as a\nduty for them to devote their property to religious purposes. Having\nsecured control of their money, the wily schemers used it for their own\nbenefit. To cover their dishonesty, they offered long prayers in public,\nand made a great show of piety. This hypocrisy Christ declared would\nbring them the greater damnation. The same rebuke falls upon many in our\nday who make a high profession of piety. Their lives are stained by\nselfishness and avarice, yet they throw over it all a garment of seeming\npurity, and thus for a time deceive their fellow men. But they cannot\ndeceive God. He reads every purpose of the heart, and will judge every\nman according to his deeds. \u00a0{DA 614.2}",
                "Christ unsparingly condemned abuses, but He was careful not to lessen\nobligation. He rebuked the selfishness that extorted and misapplied the\nwidow's gifts. At the same time He commended the widow who brought her\noffering for God's treasury. Man's abuse of the gift could not turn\nGod's blessing from the giver. \u00a0{DA 614.3}",
                "Jesus was in the court where were the treasure chests, and He watched\nthose who came to deposit their gifts. Many of the rich brought large\nsums, which they presented with great ostentation. Jesus looked upon\nthem sadly, but made no comment on their liberal offerings. Presently\nHis countenance lighted as He saw a poor widow approach hesitatingly, as\nthough fearful of being observed. As the rich and haughty swept by, to\ndeposit their offerings, she shrank back as if hardly daring to venture\nfarther. And yet she longed to do something, little though it might be,\nfor the cause she loved. She looked at the gift in her hand. It was very\nsmall in comparison with the gifts of those around her, yet it was her\nall. \u00a0Watching her opportunity, she hurriedly threw in her two mites, and\nturned to hasten away. But in doing this she caught the eye of Jesus,\nwhich was fastened earnestly upon her. \u00a0{DA 614.4}",
                "The Saviour called His disciples to Him, and bade them mark the widow's\npoverty. Then His words of commendation fell upon her ear: \"Of a truth I\nsay unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.\"\nTears of joy filled her eyes as she felt that her act was understood and\nappreciated. Many would have advised her to keep her pittance for her\nown use; given into the hands of the well-fed priests, it would be lost\nsight of among the many costly gifts brought to the treasury. But Jesus\nunderstood her motive. She believed the service of the temple to be of\nGod's appointment, and she was anxious to do her utmost to sustain it.\nShe did what she could, and her act was to be a monument to her memory\nthrough all time, and her joy in eternity. Her heart went with her gift;\nits value was estimated, not by the worth of the coin, but by the love\nto God and the interest in His work that had prompted the deed. \u00a0{DA\n615.1}",
                "Jesus said of the poor widow, She \"hath cast in more than they all.\" The\nrich had bestowed from their abundance, many of them to be seen and\nhonored by men. Their large donations had deprived them of no comfort,\nor even luxury; they had required no sacrifice, and could not be\ncompared in value with the widow's mite. \u00a0{DA 615.2}",
                "It is the motive that gives character to our acts, stamping them with\nignominy or with high moral worth. Not the great things which every eye\nsees and every tongue praises does God account most precious. The little\nduties cheerfully done, the little gifts which make no show, and which\nto human eyes may appear worthless, often stand highest in His sight. A\nheart of faith and love is dearer to God than the most costly gift. The\npoor widow gave her living to do the little that she did. She deprived\nherself of food in order to give those two mites to the cause she loved.\nAnd she did it in faith, believing that her heavenly Father would not\noverlook her great need. It was this unselfish spirit and childlike\nfaith that won the Saviour's commendation. \u00a0{DA 615.3}",
                "Among the poor there are many who long to show their gratitude to God\nfor His grace and truth. They greatly desire to share with their more\nprosperous brethren in sustaining His service. These souls should not be\nrepulsed. Let them lay up their mites in the bank of heaven. If given\nfrom a heart filled with love for God, these seeming trifles become\nconsecrated gifts, priceless offerings, which God smiles upon and\nblesses. \u00a0{DA 615.4}",
                "When Jesus said of the widow, She \"hath cast in more than they all,\" His\nwords were true, not only of the motive, but of the results of her gift.\nThe \"two mites which make a farthing\" have brought to God's treasury an\namount of money far greater than the contributions of those rich Jews.\nThe influence of that little gift has been like a stream, small in its\nbeginning, but widening and deepening as it flowed down through the\nages. In a thousand ways it has contributed to the relief of the poor\nand the spread of the gospel. Her example of self-sacrifice has acted\nand reacted upon thousands of hearts in every land and in every age. It\nhas appealed to both the rich and the poor, and their offerings have\nswelled the value of her gift. God's blessing upon the widow's mite has\nmade it the source of great results. So with every gift bestowed and\nevery act performed with a sincere desire for God's glory. It is linked\nwith the purposes of Omnipotence. Its results for good no man can\nmeasure. \u00a0{DA 616.1}",

Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the\ngold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? and, Whosoever shall\nswear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift\nthat is upon it, he is guilty. Ye fools and blind: for whether is\ngreater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?\" The priests\ninterpreted God's requirements according to their own false and narrow\nstandard. They presumed to make nice distinctions as to the comparative\nguilt of various sins, passing over some lightly, and treating others of\nperhaps less consequence as unpardonable. For a money consideration they\nexcused persons from their vows. And for large sums of money they\nsometimes passed over aggravated crimes.

The obligation itself He does not set aside. The\ntithing system was ordained by God, and it had been observed from the\nearliest times. Abraham, the father of the faithful, paid tithes of all\nthat he possessed. The Jewish rulers recognized the obligation of\ntithing, and this was right; but they did not leave the people to\ncarry \u00a0out their own convictions of duty. Arbitrary rules were laid down\nfor every case. The requirements had become so complicated that it was\nimpossible for them to be fulfilled. None knew when their obligations\nwere met. As God gave it, the system was just and reasonable; but the\npriests and rabbis had made it a wearisome burden. \u00a0{DA 616.3}",
                "All that God commands is of consequence. Christ recognized the payment\nof tithes as a duty; but He showed that this could not excuse the\nneglect of other duties. The Pharisees were very exact in tithing garden\nherbs, such as mint, anise, and rue; this cost them little, and it gave\nthem a reputation for exactness and sanctity. At the same time their\nuseless restrictions oppressed the people and destroyed respect for the\nsacred system of God's own appointing. They occupied men's minds with\ntrifling distinctions, and turned their attention from essential truths.\nThe weightier matters of the law, justice, mercy, and truth, were\nneglected. \"These,\" Christ said, \"ought ye to have done, and not to\nleave the other undone.\" \u00a0{DA 617.1}",

The use of swine's flesh, and the flesh of certain other animals,\nwas prohibited, as likely to fill the blood with impurities, and to\nshorten life. But the Pharisees did not leave these restrictions as God\nhad given them. They went to unwarranted extremes. Among other things\nthe people were required to strain all the water used, lest it should\ncontain the smallest insect, which might be classed with the unclean\nanimals.

                "In the days of Christ a superstitious regard was cherished for the\nresting places of the dead, and vast sums of money were lavished upon\ntheir decoration. In the sight of God this was idolatry. In their undue\nregard for the dead, men showed that they did not love God supremely,\nnor their neighbor as themselves. The same idolatry is carried to great\nlengths today. Many are guilty of neglecting the widow and the\nfatherless, the sick and the poor, in order to build expensive monuments\nfor the dead. Time, money, and labor are freely spent for this purpose,\nwhile duties to the living---duties which Christ has plainly\nenjoined---are left undone. \u00a0{DA 618.1}",

It should open our eyes to the\npower of Satan to deceive the mind that turns from the light of truth.\nMany follow in the track of the Pharisees. They revere those who have\ndied for their faith. They wonder at the blindness of the Jews in\nrejecting Christ. Had we lived in His day, they declare, we would gladly\nhave received His teaching; we would never have been partakers in the\nguilt of those who rejected the Saviour.

From the time when the first innocent blood was shed,\nwhen righteous Abel fell by the hand of Cain, the same history had been\nrepeated, with increasing guilt. In every age prophets had lifted up\ntheir voices against the sins of kings, rulers, and people, speaking the\nwords which God gave them, and obeying His will at the peril of their\nlives. From generation to generation there had been heaping up a\nterrible punishment for the rejecters of light and truth. This the\nenemies of Christ were now drawing down upon their own heads. The sin of\nthe priests and rulers was greater than that of any preceding\ngeneration. By their rejection of the Saviour, they were making\nthemselves responsible \u00a0for the blood of all the righteous men slain from\nAbel to Christ.

His\nblood had imprinted itself upon the very stones of the temple court, and\ncould not be erased; it remained to bear testimony against apostate\nIsrael. As long as the temple should stand, there would be the stain of\nthat righteous blood, crying to God to be avenged.

Like a grain of wheat,\nthe \u00a0Son of man must be cast into the ground and die, and be buried out\nof sight; but He was to live again. \u00a0{DA 622.2}",
                "Christ presented His future, illustrating it by the things of nature,\nthat the disciples might understand. The true result of His mission was\nto be reached by His death. \"Verily, verily, I say unto you,\" He said,\n\"Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:\nbut if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.\" When the grain of wheat\nfalls into the ground and dies, it springs up, and bears fruit. So the\ndeath of Christ would result in fruit for the kingdom of God. In\naccordance with the law of the vegetable kingdom, life was to be the\nresult of His death. \u00a0{DA 623.1}",
                "Those who till the soil have the illustration ever before them. Year by\nyear man preserves his supply of grain by apparently throwing away the\nchoicest part. For a time it must be hidden under the furrow, to be\nwatched over by the Lord. Then appears the blade, then the ear, and then\nthe corn in the ear. But this development cannot take place unless the\ngrain is buried out of sight, hidden, and to all appearance, lost. \u00a0{DA\n623.2}",
                "The seed buried in the ground produces fruit, and in turn this is\nplanted. Thus the harvest is multiplied.

                "The grain of wheat that preserves its own life can produce no fruit. It\nabides alone. Christ could, if He chose, save Himself from death. But\nshould He do this, He must abide alone. He could bring no sons and\ndaughters to God. Only by yielding up His life could He impart life to\nhumanity. Only by falling into the ground to die could He become the\nseed of that vast harvest,---the great multitude that out of every\nnation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, are redeemed to God. \u00a0{DA\n623.4}",

The life must be cast into the furrow of the world's\nneed. Self-love, self-interest, must perish. And the law of\nself-sacrifice is the law of self-preservation. The husbandman preserves\nhis grain by casting it away. So in human life. To give is to live. The\nlife that will be preserved is the life that is freely given in service\nto God and man. Those who for \u00a0Christ's sake sacrifice their life in this\nworld will keep it unto life eternal. \u00a0{DA 623.5}",

It was the joy of Christ in His\nhumiliation and pain that His disciples should be glorified with Him.\nThey are the fruit of His self-sacrifice. The outworking in them of His\nown character and spirit is His reward, and will be His joy throughout\neternity. This joy they share with Him as the fruit of their labor and\nsacrifice is seen in other hearts and lives.

The work\nof redemption passed before Him, from the time when in heaven the plan\nwas laid, to the death that was now so near at hand. A mysterious cloud\nseemed to enshroud the Son of God. Its gloom was felt by those near Him.\nHe sat rapt in thought. At last the silence was broken by His mournful\nvoice, \"Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save Me\nfrom this hour?\" In anticipation Christ was already drinking the cup of\nbitterness. His humanity shrank from the hour of abandonment, when to\nall appearance He would be deserted even by God, when all would see Him\nstricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. He shrank from public exposure,\nfrom being treated as the worst of criminals, from a shameful and\ndishonored death. A foreboding of His conflict with the powers of\ndarkness, a sense of the awful burden of human transgression, and the\nFather's wrath because of sin caused the spirit of Jesus to faint, and\nthe pallor of death to overspread His countenance. \u00a0{DA 624.3}",

Jesus consented to the agony, He\naccepted the sacrifice. The Majesty of heaven consented to suffer as the\nSin Bearer. \"Father, glorify Thy name,\" He said. As \u00a0Christ spoke these\nwords, a response came from the cloud which hovered above His head: \"I\nhave both glorified it, and will glorify it again.\" Christ's whole life,\nfrom the manger to the time when these words were spoken, had glorified\nGod; and in the coming trial His divine-human sufferings would indeed\nglorify His Father's name. \u00a0{DA 624.4}",

Now at\nthe close of His ministry it was heard for the third time, by a larger\nnumber of persons, and under peculiar circumstances. Jesus had just\nspoken the most solemn truth regarding the condition of the Jews. He had\nmade His last appeal, and pronounced their doom. Now God again set His\nseal to the mission of His Son. He recognized the One whom Israel had\nrejected. \"This voice came not because of Me,\" said Jesus, \"but for your\nsakes.\" It was the crowning evidence of His Messiahship, the signal from\nthe Father that Jesus had spoken the truth, and was the Son of God. \u00a0{DA\n625.3}",

This He said, signifying what death He\nshould die.\" This is the crisis of the world. If I become the\npropitiation for the sins of men, the world will be lighted up. Satan's\nhold upon the souls of men will be broken. The defaced image of God will\nbe restored in humanity, and a family of believing saints will finally\ninherit the heavenly home. This is the result of Christ's death. The\nSaviour is lost in contemplation of the scene of triumph called up\nbefore Him.

The foreboding of evil was shared\nby the disciples, and they anxiously waited for some more definite\nstatement from Jesus. As they passed with Him out of the temple, they\ncalled His attention to its strength and beauty. The stones of the\ntemple were of the purest marble, of perfect whiteness, and some of them\nof almost fabulous size. A portion of the wall had withstood the siege\nby Nebuchadnezzar's army.

In mercy to them He blended the description of the\ntwo great crises, leaving the disciples to study out the meaning for\nthemselves.

Those who had faith in His message for their time,\nand who acted out their faith, in obedience to His commandments, escaped\nthe judgments that fell upon the disobedient and unbelieving. The word\ncame to Noah, \"Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I\nseen righteous before Me.\" Noah obeyed and was saved. The message came\nto Lot, \"Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this\ncity.\" \u00a0Genesis 7:1; \u00a019:14. Lot placed himself under the guardianship of\nthe heavenly messengers, and was saved. So Christ's disciples were given\nwarning of the destruction of Jerusalem. Those who watched for the sign\nof the coming ruin, and fled from the city, escaped the destruction. So\nnow we are given warning of Christ's second coming and of the\ndestruction to fall upon the world. Those who heed the warning will be\nsaved. \u00a0{DA 634.1}",

Those who watch for the Lord's coming are\nnot waiting in idle expectancy. The expectation of Christ's coming is to\nmake men fear the Lord, and fear His judgments upon transgression. It is\nto awaken them to the great sin of rejecting His offers of mercy. Those\nwho are watching for the Lord are purifying their souls by obedience to\nthe truth. With vigilant watching they combine earnest working. Because\nthey know that the Lord is at the door, their zeal is quickened to\nco-operate with the divine intelligences in working for the salvation of\nsouls. These are the faithful and wise servants who give to the Lord's\nhousehold \"their portion of meat in due season.\" \u00a0Luke 12:42. They are\ndeclaring the truth that is now specially applicable. As Enoch, Noah,\nAbraham, and Moses each declared the truth for his time, so will\nChrist's servants now give the special warning for their generation. \u00a0{DA\n634.2}",

They are saying,\n\"Peace and safety.\" Like the priests and teachers before the fall of\nJerusalem, they look for the church to enjoy earthly prosperity and\nglory. The signs of the times they interpret as foreshadowing this. But\nwhat saith the word of Inspiration? \"Sudden destruction cometh upon\nthem.\" \u00a01 Thessalonians 5:3. Upon all who dwell on the face of the whole\nearth, upon all who make this world their home, the day of God will come\nas a snare. It comes to them as a prowling thief. \u00a0{DA 635.2}",

He had a full consciousness\nof His divinity; but He had laid aside His royal crown and kingly robes,\nand had taken the form of a servant.

The\ndisciples knew nothing of the purpose of Judas. Jesus alone could read\nhis secret. Yet He did not expose him. Jesus hungered for his soul. He\nfelt for him such a burden as for Jerusalem when He wept over the doomed\ncity. His heart was crying, How can I give thee up? The constraining\npower of that love was felt by Judas. When the Saviour's hands were\nbathing those soiled feet, and wiping them with the towel, the heart of\nJudas thrilled through and through with the impulse then and there to\nconfess his sin. But he would not humble himself. He hardened his heart\nagainst repentance; and the old impulses, for the moment put aside,\nagain controlled him. Judas was now offended at Christ's act in washing\nthe feet of His disciples. If Jesus could so humble Himself, he thought,\nHe could not be Israel's king. All hope of worldly honor in a temporal\nkingdom was destroyed. Judas was satisfied that there was nothing to be\ngained by following Christ. After seeing Him degrade Himself, as he\nthought, he was confirmed in his purpose to disown Him, and confess\nhimself deceived. He was possessed by a demon, and he resolved to\ncomplete the work he had agreed to do in betraying his Lord. \u00a0{DA 645.1}",

John, toward whom Judas\nhad felt so much bitterness, was left till the last. But John did not\ntake this as a rebuke or slight. As the disciples watched Christ's\naction, they were greatly moved. When Peter's turn came, he exclaimed\nwith astonishment, \"Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?\" Christ's\ncondescension broke his heart. He was filled with shame to think that\none of the disciples was not performing this service. \"What I do,\"\nChrist said, \"thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.\"\nPeter could not bear to see his Lord, whom he believed to be the Son of\nGod, acting the part of a servant. His whole soul rose up against this\nhumiliation. \u00a0He did not realize that for this Christ came into the\nworld. With great emphasis he exclaimed, \"Thou shalt never wash my\nfeet.\" \u00a0{DA 645.2}",
                "Solemnly Christ said to Peter, \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part\nwith Me.\" The service which Peter refused was the type of a higher\ncleansing. Christ had come to wash the heart from the stain of sin. In\nrefusing to allow Christ to wash his feet, Peter was refusing the higher\ncleansing included in the lower. He was really rejecting his Lord. It is\nnot humiliating to the Master to allow Him to work for our purification.\nThe truest humility is to receive with thankful heart any provision made\nin our behalf, and with earnestness do service for Christ. \u00a0{DA 646.1}",
                "At the words, \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me,\" Peter\nsurrendered his pride and self-will.

He who came from\nthe bath was clean, but the sandaled feet soon became dusty, and again\nneeded to be washed. So Peter and his brethren had been washed in the\ngreat fountain opened for sin and uncleanness. Christ acknowledged them\nas His. But temptation had led them into evil, and they still needed His\ncleansing grace. When Jesus girded Himself with a towel to wash the dust\nfrom their feet, He desired by that very act to wash the alienation,\njealousy, and pride from their hearts. This was of far more consequence\nthan the washing of their dusty feet. With the spirit they then had, not\none of them was prepared for communion with Christ. Until brought into a\nstate of humility and love, they were not prepared to partake of the\npaschal supper, or to share in the memorial service which Christ was\nabout to institute. Their hearts must be cleansed. Pride and\nself-seeking create dissension and hatred, but all this Jesus washed\naway in washing their feet. A change of feeling was brought about.\nLooking upon them, Jesus could say, \"Ye are clean.\" Now there was union\nof heart, love for one another. They had become humble and teachable.\nExcept Judas, each was ready to concede to another the highest place.\nNow with subdued and grateful hearts they could receive Christ's\nwords. \u00a0{DA 646.3}",

That His people might not be misled by the selfishness which\ndwells in the natural heart, and which strengthens by self-serving,\nChrist Himself set the example of humility. He would not leave this\ngreat subject in man's charge. Of so much consequence did He regard it,\nthat He Himself, One equal with God, acted as servant to His disciples.\nWhile they were contending for the highest place, He to whom every knee\nshall bow, He whom the angels of glory count it honor to serve, bowed\ndown to wash the feet of those who called Him Lord.

This ideal of ministry God has committed to His\nSon. Jesus was given to stand at the head of humanity, that by His\nexample He might teach what it means to minister. His whole life was\nunder a law of service. He served all, ministered to all. Thus He lived\nthe law of God, and by His example showed how we are to obey it. \u00a0{DA\n649.4}",

                "Now, having washed the disciples' feet, He said, \"I have given you an\nexample, that ye should do as I have done to you.\" In these words Christ\nwas not merely enjoining the practice of hospitality. More was meant\nthan the washing of the feet of guests to remove the dust of travel.\nChrist was here instituting a religious service. By the act of our Lord\nthis humiliating ceremony was made a consecrated ordinance.

While pride, variance, and strife for supremacy are cherished,\nthe heart cannot enter into fellowship with Christ. We are not prepared\nto receive the communion of His body and His blood.

And the administration of\nthe Sacrament was to keep before the disciples the infinite sacrifice\nmade for each of them individually as a part of the great whole of\nfallen humanity. \u00a0{DA 656.5}",
                "But the Communion service was not to be a season of sorrowing. This was\nnot its purpose. As the Lord's disciples gather about His table, they\nare not to remember and lament their shortcomings. They are not to dwell\nupon their past religious experience, whether that experience has been\nelevating or depressing. They are not to recall the differences between\nthem and their brethren. The preparatory service has embraced all this.\nThe self-examination, the confession of sin, the reconciling of\ndifferences, has all been done. Now they come to meet with Christ. They\nare not to stand in the shadow of the cross, but in its saving light.\nThey are to open the soul to the bright beams of the Sun of\nRighteousness. With hearts cleansed by Christ's most precious blood, in\nfull consciousness of His presence, although unseen, they are to hear\nHis words, \"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the\nworld giveth, give I unto you.\" \u00a0John 14:27. \u00a0{DA 659.1}",
                "Our Lord says, Under conviction of sin, remember that I died for you.\nWhen oppressed and persecuted and afflicted for My sake and the\ngospel's, remember My love, so great that for you I gave My life. When\nyour duties appear stern and severe, and your burdens too heavy to bear,\nremember that for your sake I endured the cross, despising the shame.\nWhen your heart shrinks from the trying ordeal, remember that your\nRedeemer liveth to make intercession for you. \u00a0{DA 659.2}",
                "The Communion service points to Christ's second coming. It was designed\nto keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples. Whenever they met\ntogether to commemorate His death, they recounted how \"He took the cup,\nand gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for\nthis is My blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the\nremission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of\nthis fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in\nMy Father's kingdom.\" In their tribulation they found comfort in the\nhope of their Lord's return. Unspeakably precious to them was the\nthought, \"As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show\nthe Lord's death till He come.\" \u00a01 Corinthians 11:26. \u00a0{DA 659.3}",
                "These are the things we are never to forget. The love of Jesus, with its\nconstraining power, is to be kept fresh in our memory. Christ has\ninstituted this service that it may speak to our senses of the love of\nGod that has been expressed in our behalf. There can be no union between\nour souls and God except through Christ. The union and love between\nbrother and brother must be cemented and rendered eternal by the love of\nJesus. And nothing less than the death of Christ could make His love\nefficacious for us. It is only because of His death that we can look\nwith joy to His second coming. His sacrifice is the center of our hope.\nUpon this we must fix our faith. \u00a0{DA 660.1}",
                "The ordinances that point to our Lord's humiliation and suffering are\nregarded too much as a form. They were instituted for a purpose. Our\nsenses need to be quickened to lay hold of the mystery of godliness. It\nis the privilege of all to comprehend, far more than we do, the\nexpiatory sufferings of Christ. \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the\nwilderness,\" even so has the Son of man been lifted up, \"that whosoever\nbelieveth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.\" \u00a0John 3:14,\n15. To the cross of Calvary, bearing a dying Saviour, we must look. Our\neternal interests demand that we show faith in Christ. \u00a0{DA 660.2}",
                "Our Lord has said, \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink\nHis blood, ye have no life in you\\.... For My flesh is meat indeed, and\nMy blood is drink indeed.\" \u00a0John 6:53-55. This is true of our physical\nnature. To the death of Christ we owe even this earthly life. The bread\nwe eat is the purchase of His broken body. The water we drink is bought\nby His spilled blood. Never one, saint or sinner, eats his daily food,\nbut he is nourished by the body and the blood of Christ. The cross of\nCalvary is stamped on every loaf. It is reflected in every water spring.\nAll this Christ has taught in appointing the emblems of His great\nsacrifice. The light shining from that Communion service in the upper\nchamber makes sacred the provisions for our daily life. The family board\nbecomes as the table of the Lord, and every meal a sacrament. \u00a0{DA 660.3}",
                "And how much more are Christ's words true of our spiritual nature. He\ndeclares, \"Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal\nlife.\" It is by receiving the life for us poured out on Calvary's cross,\nthat we can live the life of holiness. And this life we receive by\nreceiving His word, by doing those things which He has commanded. Thus\nwe become one with Him. \"He that eateth My flesh,\" He says, \"and\ndrinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. As the living \u00a0Father\nhath sent Me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth Me, even he\nshall live by Me.\" \u00a0John 6:54, 56, 57. To the holy Communion this\nscripture in a special sense applies. As faith contemplates our Lord's\ngreat sacrifice, the soul assimilates the spiritual life of Christ. That\nsoul will receive spiritual strength from every Communion. The service\nforms a living connection by which the believer is bound up with Christ,\nand thus bound up with the Father. In a special sense it forms a\nconnection between dependent human beings and God. \u00a0{DA 660.4}",
                "As we receive the bread and wine symbolizing Christ's broken body and\nspilled blood, we in imagination join in the scene of Communion in the\nupper chamber. We seem to be passing through the garden consecrated by\nthe agony of Him who bore the sins of the world. We witness the struggle\nby which our reconciliation with God was obtained. Christ is set forth\ncrucified among us. \u00a0{DA 661.1}",

He was the\nway when Adam lived, when Abel presented to God the blood of the slain\nlamb, representing the blood of the Redeemer. Christ was the way by\nwhich patriarchs and prophets were saved.

He\ndesired them to see that their faith must lead up to God, and be\nanchored there.

He first dwells in the heart as the Spirit of truth,\nand thus He becomes the Comforter. There is comfort and peace in the\ntruth, but no real peace or comfort can be found in falsehood. It is\nthrough false theories and traditions that Satan gains his power over\nthe mind. By directing men to false standards, he misshapes the\ncharacter. Through the Scriptures the Holy Spirit speaks to the mind,\nand impresses truth upon the heart. Thus He exposes error, and expels it\nfrom the soul. It is by the Spirit of truth, working through the word of\nGod, that Christ subdues His chosen people to Himself.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 671.1}",
                "In describing to His disciples the office work of the Holy Spirit, Jesus\nsought to inspire them with the joy and hope that inspired His own\nheart. He rejoiced because of the abundant help He had provided for His\nchurch. The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could\nsolicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was\nto be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of\nChrist would have been of no avail. The power of evil had been\nstrengthening for centuries, and the submission of men to this satanic\ncaptivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through\nthe mighty agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would come\nwith no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the\nSpirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world's\nRedeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the\nSpirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has\ngiven His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and\ncultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His\nchurch.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 671.2}",
                "Of the Spirit Jesus said, \"He shall glorify Me.\" The Saviour came to\nglorify the Father by the demonstration of His love; so the Spirit was\nto glorify Christ by revealing His grace to the world. The very image of\nGod is to be reproduced in humanity. The honor of God, the honor of\nChrist, is involved in the perfection of the character of His\npeople.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 671.3}",
                "\"When He \\[the Spirit of truth\\] is come, He will reprove the world of\nsin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.\" The preaching of the word\nwill be of no avail without the continual presence and aid of the Holy\nSpirit. This is the only effectual teacher of divine truth. Only\u00c2\u00a0when\nthe truth is accompanied to the heart by the Spirit will it quicken the\nconscience or transform the life. One might be able to present the\nletter of the word of God, he might be familiar with all its commands\nand promises; but unless the Holy Spirit sets home the truth, no souls\nwill fall on the Rock and be broken. No amount of education, no\nadvantages, however great, can make one a channel of light without the\nco-operation of the Spirit of God. The sowing of the gospel seed will\nnot be a success unless the seed is quickened into life by the dew of\nheaven. Before one book of the New Testament was written, before one\ngospel sermon had been preached after Christ's ascension, the Holy\nSpirit came upon the praying apostles. Then the testimony of their\nenemies was, \"Ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.\"\u00c2\u00a0Acts\n5:28.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 671.4}",
                "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the\npromise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples.

Through the\nSpirit God works in His people \"to will and to do of His good\npleasure.\"\u00c2\u00a0Philippians 2:13. But many will not submit to this. They want\nto manage themselves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift.\nOnly to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and\ngrace, is the Spirit given. The power of God awaits their demand and\nreception. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other\nblessings in its train.

Through the crowded streets they made\ntheir way, passing out of the city gate toward the Mount of Olives.\nSlowly they proceeded, each busy with his own thoughts. As they began to\ndescend toward the mount, Jesus said, in a tone of deepest sadness, \"All\nye shall be offended because of Me this night: for it is written, I will\nsmite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered\nabroad.\"\u00c2\u00a0Matthew 26:31. The disciples listened in sorrow and amazement.\nThey remembered how in the synagogue at Capernaum, when Christ spoke of\nHimself as the bread of life, many had been offended, and had turned\naway from Him. But the twelve had not shown themselves unfaithful.\nPeter, speaking for his brethren, had then declared his loyalty to\nChrist. Then the Saviour had said, \"Have not I chosen you twelve, and\none of you is a devil?\"\u00c2\u00a0John 6:70. In the upper chamber Jesus said that\none of the twelve would betray Him, and that Peter would deny Him. But\nnow His words include them all.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 673.1}",
                "Now Peter's voice is heard vehemently protesting, \"Although all shall be\noffended, yet will not I.\" In the upper chamber he had declared, \"I will\nlay down my life for Thy sake.\" Jesus had warned him that he would that\nvery night deny his Saviour. Now Christ repeats the warning: \"Verily I\nsay unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow\ntwice, thou shalt deny Me thrice.\" But Peter only \"spake the more\nvehemently, If I should die with Thee, I will not deny Thee in anywise.\nLikewise also said they all.\"\u00c2\u00a0Mark 14:29, 30, 31. In their\nself-confidence they denied the repeated statement of Him who knew. They\nwere unprepared for the test; when temptation should overtake them, they\nwould understand their own weakness.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 673.2}",
                "When Peter said he would follow his Lord to prison and to death, he\nmeant it, every word of it; but he did not know himself. Hidden in his\nheart were elements of evil that circumstances would fan into life.\nUnless he was made conscious of his danger, these would prove his\neternal ruin. The Saviour saw in him a self-love and assurance that\nwould overbear even his love for Christ. Much of infirmity, of\nunmortified sin, carelessness of spirit, unsanctified temper,\nheedlessness in entering into temptation, had been revealed in his\nexperience. Christ's solemn warning was a call to heart searching. Peter\nneeded to distrust himself, and to have a deeper faith in Christ. Had he\nin humility received the warning, he would have appealed to the Shepherd\nof the flock to keep His sheep. When on the Sea of Galilee he was about\nto sink, he cried, \"Lord, save me.\"\u00c2\u00a0Matthew 14:30. Then the hand of\nChrist was outstretched\u00c2\u00a0to grasp his hand. So now if he had cried to\nJesus, Save me from myself, he would have been kept. But Peter felt that\nhe was distrusted, and he thought it cruel. He was already offended, and\nhe became more persistent in his self-confidence.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 673.3}",
                "Jesus looks with compassion on His disciples. He cannot save them from\nthe trial, but He does not leave them comfortless. He assures them that\nHe is to break the fetters of the tomb, and that His love for them will\nnot fail. \"After I am risen again,\" He says, \"I will go before you into\nGalilee.\"\u00c2\u00a0Matthew 26:32. Before the denial, they have the assurance of\nforgiveness. After His death and resurrection, they knew that they were\nforgiven, and were dear to the heart of Christ.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 674.1}",
                "Jesus and the disciples were on the way to Gethsemane, at the foot of\nMount Olivet, a retired spot which He had often visited for meditation\nand prayer. The Saviour had been explaining to His disciples His mission\nto the world, and the spiritual relation to Him which they were to\nsustain. Now He illustrates the lesson. The moon is shining bright, and\nreveals to Him a flourishing grapevine. Drawing the attention of the\ndisciples to it, He employs it as a symbol.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 674.2}",
                "\"I am the true Vine,\" He says. Instead of choosing the graceful palm,\nthe lofty cedar, or the strong oak, Jesus takes the vine with its\nclinging tendrils to represent Himself. The palm tree, the cedar, and\nthe oak stand alone. They require no support. But the vine entwines\nabout the trellis, and thus climbs heavenward. So Christ in His humanity\nwas\u00c2\u00a0dependent upon divine power. \"I can of Mine own self do nothing,\" He\ndeclared.\u00c2\u00a0John 5:30.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 674.3}",
                "\"I am the true Vine.\" The Jews had always regarded the vine as the most\nnoble of plants, and a type of all that was powerful, excellent, and\nfruitful. Israel had been represented as a vine which God had planted in\nthe Promised Land. The Jews based their hope of salvation on the fact of\ntheir connection with Israel. But Jesus says, I am the real Vine. Think\nnot that through a connection with Israel you may become partakers of\nthe life of God, and inheritors of His promise. Through Me alone is\nspiritual life received.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 675.1}",
                "\"I am the true Vine, and My Father is the husbandman.\" On the hills of\nPalestine our heavenly Father had planted this goodly Vine, and He\nHimself was the husbandman. Many were attracted by the beauty of this\nVine, and declared its heavenly origin. But to the leaders in Israel it\nappeared as a root out of a dry ground. They took the plant, and bruised\nit, and trampled it under their unholy feet. Their thought was to\ndestroy it forever. But the heavenly Husbandman never lost sight of His\nplant. After men thought they had killed it, He took it, and replanted\nit on the other side of the wall. The vine stock was to be no longer\nvisible. It was hidden from the rude assaults of men. But the branches\nof the Vine hung over the wall. They were to represent the Vine. Through\nthem grafts might still be united to the Vine. From them fruit has been\nobtained. There has been a harvest which the passers-by have\nplucked.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 675.2}",
                "\"I am the Vine, ye are the branches,\" Christ said to His disciples.\nThough He was about to be removed from them, their spiritual union with\nHim was to be unchanged. The connection of the branch with the vine, He\nsaid, represents the relation you are to sustain to Me. The scion is\nengrafted into the living vine, and fiber by fiber, vein by vein, it\ngrows into the vine stock. The life of the vine becomes the life of the\nbranch. So the soul dead in trespasses and sins receives life through\nconnection with Christ. By faith in Him as a personal Saviour the union\nis formed. The sinner unites his weakness to Christ's strength, his\nemptiness to Christ's fullness, his frailty to Christ's enduring might.\nThen he has the mind of Christ. The humanity of Christ has touched our\nhumanity, and our humanity has touched divinity. Thus through the agency\nof the Holy Spirit man becomes a partaker of the divine nature. He is\naccepted in the Beloved.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 675.3}",
                "This union with Christ, once formed, must be maintained. Christ said,\n\"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,\nexcept it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me.\"\nThis is no casual touch, no off-and-on connection. The branch becomes a\npart of the living vine. The communication of life, strength, and\nfruitfulness from the root to the branches is unobstructed and constant.\nSeparated from the vine, the branch cannot live. No more, said Jesus,\ncan you live apart from Me. The life you have received from Me can be\npreserved only by continual communion. Without Me you cannot overcome\none sin, or resist one temptation.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 676.1}",
                "\"Abide in Me, and I in you.\" Abiding in Christ means a constant\nreceiving of His Spirit, a life of unreserved surrender to His service.\nThe channel of communication must be open continually between man and\nhis God. As the vine branch constantly draws the sap from the living\nvine, so are we to cling to Jesus, and receive from Him by faith the\nstrength and perfection of His own character.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 676.2}",
                "The root sends its nourishment through the branch to the outermost twig.\nSo Christ communicates the current of spiritual strength to every\nbeliever. So long as the soul is united to Christ, there is no danger\nthat it will wither or decay.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 676.3}",
                "The life of the vine will be manifest in fragrant fruit on the branches.\n\"He that abideth in Me,\" said Jesus, \"and I in him, the same bringeth\nforth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing.\" When we live by\nfaith on the Son of God, the fruits of the Spirit will be seen in our\nlives; not one will be missing.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 676.4}",
                "\"My Father is the husbandman. Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit\nHe taketh away.\" While the graft is outwardly united with the vine,\nthere may be no vital connection. Then there will be no growth or\nfruitfulness. So there may be an apparent connection with Christ without\na real union with Him by faith. A profession of religion places men in\nthe church, but the character and conduct show whether they are in\nconnection with Christ. If they bear no fruit, they are false branches.\nTheir separation from Christ involves a ruin as complete as that\nrepresented by the dead branch. \"If a man abide not in Me,\" said Christ,\n\"he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and\ncast them into the fire, and they are burned.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 676.5}",
                "\"And every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth \\[pruneth\\] it, that it\nmay bring forth more fruit.\" From the chosen twelve who had\nfollowed\u00c2\u00a0Jesus, one as a withered branch was about to be taken away; the\nrest were to pass under the pruning knife of bitter trial. Jesus with\nsolemn tenderness explained the purpose of the husbandman. The pruning\nwill cause pain, but it is the Father who applies the knife. He works\nwith no wanton hand or indifferent heart. There are branches trailing\nupon the ground; these must be cut loose from the earthly supports to\nwhich their tendrils are fastening. They are to reach heavenward, and\nfind their support in God. The excessive foliage that draws away the\nlife current from the fruit must be pruned off. The overgrowth must be\ncut out, to give room for the healing beams of the Sun of Righteousness.\nThe husbandman prunes away the harmful growth, that the fruit may be\nricher and more abundant.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 676.6}",
                "\"Herein is My Father glorified,\" said Jesus, \"that ye bear much fruit.\"\nGod desires to manifest through you the holiness, the benevolence, the\ncompassion, of His own character. Yet the Saviour does not bid the\ndisciples labor to bear fruit. He tells them to abide in Him. \"If ye\nabide in Me,\" He says, \"and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye\nwill, and it shall be done unto you.\" It is through the word that Christ\nabides in His followers. This is the same vital union that is\nrepresented by eating His flesh and drinking His blood. The words of\nChrist are spirit and life. Receiving them, you receive the life of the\nVine. You live \"by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of\nGod.\"\u00c2\u00a0Matthew 4:4. The life of Christ in you produces the same fruits as\nin Him. Living in Christ, adhering to Christ, supported by Christ,\ndrawing nourishment from Christ, you bear fruit after the similitude of\nChrist.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 677.1}",
                "In this last meeting with His disciples, the great desire which Christ\nexpressed for them was that they might love one another as He had loved\nthem. Again and again He spoke of this. \"These things I command you,\" He\nsaid repeatedly, \"that ye love one another.\" His very first injunction\nwhen alone with them in the upper chamber was, \"A new commandment I give\nunto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also\nlove one another.\" To the disciples this commandment was new; for they\nhad not loved one another as Christ had loved them. He saw that new\nideas and impulses must control them; that new principles must be\npracticed by them; through His life and death they were to receive a new\nconception of love. The command to love one another had a new meaning in\nthe light of His self-sacrifice. The whole\u00c2\u00a0work of grace is one\ncontinual service of love, of self-denying, self-sacrificing effort.\nDuring every hour of Christ's sojourn upon the earth, the love of God\nwas flowing from Him in irrepressible streams. All who are imbued with\nHis Spirit will love as He loved. The very principle that actuated\nChrist will actuate them in all their dealing one with another.\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n677.2}",
                "This love is the evidence of their discipleship. \"By this shall all men\nknow that ye are My disciples,\" said Jesus, \"if ye have love one to\nanother.\" When men are bound together, not by force or self-interest,\nbut by love, they show the working of an influence that is above every\nhuman influence. Where this oneness exists, it is evidence that the\nimage of God is being restored in humanity, that a new principle of life\nhas been implanted. It shows that there is power in the divine nature to\nwithstand the supernatural agencies of evil, and that the grace of God\nsubdues the selfishness inherent in the natural heart.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 678.1}",
                "This love, manifested in the church, will surely stir the wrath of\nSatan. Christ did not mark out for His disciples an easy path. \"If the\nworld hate you,\" He said, \"ye know that it hated Me before it hated you.\nIf ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye\nare not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore\nthe world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The\nservant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted Me, they\nwill also persecute you; if they have kept My saying, they will keep\nyours also. But all these things will they do unto you for My name's\nsake, because they know not Him that sent Me.\" The gospel is to be\ncarried forward by aggressive warfare, in the midst of opposition,\nperil, loss, and suffering.

                "As the world's Redeemer, Christ was constantly confronted with apparent\nfailure. He, the messenger of mercy to our world, seemed to do little of\nthe work He longed to do in uplifting and saving. Satanic influences\nwere constantly working to oppose His way. But He would not be\ndiscouraged. Through the prophecy of Isaiah He declares, \"I have labored\nin vain, I have spent My strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely My\njudgment is with the Lord, and My work with My God\\.... Though Israel be\nnot gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and My\nGod shall be My strength.\" It is to Christ that the promise is given,\n\"Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and His Holy One, to Him\nwhom man despiseth, to Him whom the nation\u00c2\u00a0abhorreth; \\... thus saith\nthe Lord: \\...

With\nprophetic eye Christ traced the scenes to take place in His last great\nconflict. He knew that when He should exclaim, \"It is finished,\" all\nheaven would triumph. His ear caught the distant music and the shouts of\nvictory in the heavenly courts. He knew that the knell of Satan's empire\nwould then be sounded, and the name of Christ would be heralded from\nworld to world throughout the universe.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 679.1}",

                "In company with His disciples, the Saviour slowly made His way to the\ngarden of Gethsemane. The Passover moon, broad and full, shone from a\ncloudless sky. The city of pilgrims' tents was hushed into silence.\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n685.1}",
                "Jesus had been earnestly conversing with His disciples and instructing\nthem; but as He neared Gethsemane, He became strangely silent. He had\noften visited this spot for meditation and prayer; but never with a\nheart so full of sorrow as upon this night of His last agony. Throughout\nHis life on earth He had walked in the light of God's presence. When in\nconflict with men who were inspired by the very spirit of Satan, He\ncould say, \"He that sent Me is with Me: the Father hath not left Me\nalone; for I do always those things that please Him.\"\u00c2\u00a0John 8:29. But now\nHe seemed to be shut out from the light of God's sustaining presence.\nNow He was numbered with the transgressors. The guilt of fallen humanity\nHe must bear. Upon Him who knew no sin must be laid the iniquity of us\nall. So dreadful does sin appear to Him, so great is the weight of guilt\nwhich He must bear, that He is tempted to fear it will shut Him out\nforever from His Father's love. Feeling how terrible is the wrath of God\nagainst transgression, He exclaims, \"My soul is exceeding sorrowful,\neven unto death.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 685.2}",
                "As they approached the garden, the disciples had marked the change that\ncame over their Master. Never before had they seen Him so utterly\u00c2\u00a0sad\nand silent. As He proceeded, this strange sadness deepened; yet they\ndared not question Him as to the cause. His form swayed as if He were\nabout to fall. Upon reaching the garden, the disciples looked anxiously\nfor His usual place of retirement, that their Master might rest. Every\nstep that He now took was with labored effort. He groaned aloud, as if\nsuffering under the pressure of a terrible burden. Twice His companions\nsupported Him, or He would have fallen to the earth.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 685.3}",
                "Near the entrance to the garden, Jesus left all but three of the\ndisciples, bidding them pray for themselves and for Him. With Peter,\nJames, and John, He entered its secluded recesses. These three disciples\nwere Christ's closest companions. They had beheld His glory on the mount\nof transfiguration; they had seen Moses and Elijah talking with Him;\nthey had heard the voice from heaven; now in His great struggle, Christ\ndesired their presence near Him. Often they had passed the night with\nHim in this retreat. On these occasions, after a season of watching and\nprayer, they would sleep undisturbed at a little distance from their\nMaster, until He awoke them in the morning to go forth anew to labor.\nBut now He desired them to spend the night with Him in prayer. Yet He\ncould not bear that even they should witness the agony He was to\nendure.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 686.1}",
                "\"Tarry ye here,\" He said, \"and watch with Me.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 686.2}",
                "He went a little distance from them---not so far but that they could\nboth see and hear Him---and fell prostrate upon the ground. He felt that\nby sin He was being separated from His Father. The gulf was so broad, so\nblack, so deep, that His spirit shuddered before it. This agony He must\nnot exert His divine power to escape. As man He must suffer the\nconsequences of man's sin. As man He must endure the wrath of God\nagainst transgression.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 686.3}",
                "Christ was now standing in a different attitude from that in which He\nhad ever stood before. His suffering can best be described in the words\nof the prophet, \"Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, and against the\nman that is My fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.\"\u00c2\u00a0Zechariah 13:7. As the\nsubstitute and surety for sinful man, Christ was suffering under divine\njustice. He saw what justice meant. Hitherto He had been as an\nintercessor for others; now He longed to have an intercessor for\nHimself.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 686.4}",
                "As Christ felt His unity with the Father broken up, He feared that in\nHis human nature He would be unable to endure the coming conflict with\nthe powers of darkness. In the wilderness of temptation the destiny of\nthe human race had been at stake. Christ was then conqueror. Now\u00c2\u00a0the\ntempter had come for the last fearful struggle. For this he had been\npreparing during the three years of Christ's ministry. Everything was at\nstake with him. If he failed here, his hope of mastery was lost; the\nkingdoms of the world would finally become Christ's; he himself would be\noverthrown and cast out. But if Christ could be overcome, the earth\nwould become Satan's kingdom, and the human race would be forever in his\npower. With the issues of the conflict before Him, Christ's soul was\nfilled with dread of separation from God. Satan told Him that if He\nbecame the surety for a sinful world, the separation would be eternal.\nHe would be identified with Satan's kingdom, and would nevermore be one\nwith God.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 686.5}",
                "And what was to be gained by this sacrifice? How hopeless appeared the\nguilt and ingratitude of men! In its hardest features Satan pressed the\nsituation upon the Redeemer: The people who claim to be above all others\nin temporal and spiritual advantages have rejected You. They are seeking\nto destroy You, the foundation, the center and seal of the promises made\nto them as a peculiar people. One of Your own disciples, who has\nlistened to Your instruction, and has been among the foremost in church\nactivities, will betray You. One of Your most zealous followers will\ndeny You. All will forsake You. Christ's whole being abhorred the\nthought. That those whom He had undertaken to save, those whom He loved\nso much, should unite in the plots of Satan, this pierced His soul. The\nconflict was terrible. Its measure was the guilt of His nation, of His\naccusers and betrayer, the guilt of a world lying in wickedness. The\nsins of men weighed heavily upon Christ, and the sense of God's wrath\nagainst sin was crushing out His life.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 687.1}",
                "Behold Him contemplating the price to be paid for the human soul. In His\nagony He clings to the cold ground, as if to prevent Himself from being\ndrawn farther from God. The chilling dew of night falls upon His\nprostrate form, but He heeds it not. From His pale lips comes the bitter\ncry, \"O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me.\" Yet\neven now He adds, \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n687.2}",
                "The human heart longs for sympathy in suffering. This longing Christ\nfelt to the very depths of His being. In the supreme agony of His soul\nHe came to His disciples with a yearning desire to hear some words of\ncomfort from those whom He had so often blessed and comforted, and\nshielded in sorrow and distress. The One who had always had words of\nsympathy for them was now suffering superhuman agony, and He longed to\nknow that they were praying for Him and for themselves.\u00c2\u00a0How dark seemed\nthe malignity of sin! Terrible was the temptation to let the human race\nbear the consequences of its own guilt, while He stood innocent before\nGod. If He could only know that His disciples understood and appreciated\nthis, He would be strengthened.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 687.3}",
                "Rising with painful effort, He staggered to the place where He had left\nHis companions. But He \"findeth them asleep.\" Had He found them praying,\nHe would have been relieved. Had they been seeking refuge in God, that\nsatanic agencies might not prevail over them, He would have been\ncomforted by their steadfast faith. But they had not heeded the repeated\nwarning, \"Watch and pray.\" At first they had been much troubled to see\ntheir Master, usually so calm and dignified, wrestling with a sorrow\nthat was beyond comprehension. They had prayed as they heard the strong\ncries of the sufferer. They did not intend to forsake their Lord, but\nthey seemed paralyzed by a stupor which they might have shaken off if\nthey had continued pleading with God. They did not realize the necessity\nof watchfulness and earnest prayer in order to withstand temptation.\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n688.1}",
                "Just before He bent His footsteps to the garden, Jesus had said to the\ndisciples, \"All ye shall be offended because of Me this night.\" They had\ngiven Him the strongest assurance that they would go with Him to prison\nand to death. And poor, self-sufficient Peter had added, \"Although all\nshall be offended, yet will not I.\"\u00c2\u00a0Mark 14:27, 29. But the\u00c2\u00a0disciples\ntrusted to themselves. They did not look to the mighty Helper as Christ\nhad counseled them to do. Thus when the Saviour was most in need of\ntheir sympathy and prayers, they were found asleep. Even Peter was\nsleeping.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 688.2}",
                "And John, the loving disciple who had leaned upon the breast of Jesus,\nwas asleep. Surely, the love of John for his Master should have kept him\nawake. His earnest prayers should have mingled with those of his loved\nSaviour in the time of His supreme sorrow. The Redeemer had spent entire\nnights praying for His disciples, that their faith might not fail.\nShould Jesus now put to James and John the question He had once asked\nthem, \"Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be\nbaptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\" they would not have\nventured to answer, \"We are able.\"\u00c2\u00a0Matthew 20:22.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 689.1}",
                "The disciples awakened at the voice of Jesus, but they hardly knew Him,\nHis face was so changed by anguish. Addressing Peter, Jesus said,\n\"Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? Watch ye and\npray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the\nflesh is weak.\" The weakness of His disciples awakened the sympathy of\nJesus. He feared that they would not be able to endure the test which\nwould come upon them in His betrayal and death. He did not reprove them,\nbut said, \"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\" Even in\nHis great agony, He was seeking to excuse their weakness. \"The spirit\ntruly is ready,\" He said, \"but the flesh is weak.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 689.2}",
                "Again the Son of God was seized with superhuman agony, and fainting and\nexhausted, He staggered back to the place of His former struggle. His\nsuffering was even greater than before. As the agony of soul came upon\nHim, \"His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the\nground.\" The cypress and palm trees were the silent witnesses of His\nanguish. From their leafy branches dropped heavy dew upon His stricken\nform, as if nature wept over its Author wrestling alone with the powers\nof darkness.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 689.3}",
                "A short time before, Jesus had stood like a mighty cedar, withstanding\nthe storm of opposition that spent its fury upon Him. Stubborn wills,\nand hearts filled with malice and subtlety, had striven in vain to\nconfuse and overpower Him. He stood forth in divine majesty as the Son\nof God. Now He was like a reed beaten and bent by the angry storm. He\nhad approached the consummation of His work a conqueror, having at each\nstep gained the victory over the powers of darkness. As\u00c2\u00a0one already\nglorified, He had claimed oneness with God. In unfaltering accents He\nhad poured out His songs of praise. He had spoken to His disciples in\nwords of courage and tenderness. Now had come the hour of the power of\ndarkness. Now His voice was heard on the still evening air, not in tones\nof triumph, but full of human anguish. The words of the Saviour were\nborne to the ears of the drowsy disciples, \"O My Father, if this cup may\nnot pass away from Me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 689.4}",
                "The first impulse of the disciples was to go to Him; but He had bidden\nthem tarry there, watching unto prayer. When Jesus came to them, He\nfound them still sleeping. Again He had felt a longing for\ncompanionship, for some words from His disciples which would bring\nrelief, and break the spell of darkness that well-nigh overpowered Him.\nBut their eyes were heavy; \"neither wist they what to answer Him.\" His\npresence aroused them. They saw His face marked with the bloody sweat of\nagony, and they were filled with fear. His anguish of mind they could\nnot understand. \"His visage was so marred more than any man, and His\nform more than the sons of men.\"\u00c2\u00a0Isaiah 52:14.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 690.1}",
                "Turning away, Jesus sought again His retreat, and fell prostrate,\novercome by the horror of a great darkness. The humanity of the Son of\nGod trembled in that trying hour. He prayed not now for His disciples\nthat their faith might not fail, but for His own tempted, agonized soul.\nThe awful moment had come---that moment which was to decide the destiny\nof the world. The fate of humanity trembled in the balance. Christ might\neven now refuse to drink the cup apportioned to guilty man. It was not\nyet too late. He might wipe the bloody sweat from His brow, and leave\nman to perish in his iniquity. He might say, Let the transgressor\nreceive the penalty of his sin, and I will go back to My Father. Will\nthe Son of God drink the bitter cup of humiliation and agony? Will the\ninnocent suffer the consequences of the curse of sin, to save the\nguilty? The words fall tremblingly from the pale lips of Jesus, \"O My\nFather, if this cup may not pass away from Me, except I drink it, Thy\nwill be done.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 690.2}",
                "Three times has He uttered that prayer. Three times has humanity shrunk\nfrom the last, crowning sacrifice. But now the history of the human race\ncomes up before the world's Redeemer. He sees that the transgressors of\nthe law, if left to themselves, must perish. He sees the helplessness of\nman. He sees the power of sin. The woes and lamentations of a doomed\nworld rise before Him. He beholds its impending\u00c2\u00a0fate, and His decision\nis made. He will save man at any cost to Himself. He accepts His baptism\nof blood, that through Him perishing millions may gain everlasting life.\nHe has left the courts of heaven, where all is purity, happiness, and\nglory, to save the one lost sheep, the one world that has fallen by\ntransgression. And He will not turn from His mission. He will become the\npropitiation of a race that has willed to sin. His prayer now breathes\nonly submission: \"If this cup may not pass away from Me, except I drink\nit, Thy will be done.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 690.3}",
                "Having made the decision, He fell dying to the ground from which He had\npartially risen. Where now were His disciples, to place their hands\ntenderly beneath the head of their fainting Master, and bathe that brow,\nmarred indeed more than the sons of men? The Saviour trod the wine press\nalone, and of the people there was none with Him.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 693.1}",
                "But God suffered with His Son. Angels beheld the Saviour's agony. They\nsaw their Lord enclosed by legions of satanic forces, His nature weighed\ndown with a shuddering, mysterious dread. There was silence in heaven.\nNo harp was touched. Could mortals have viewed the amazement of the\nangelic host as in silent grief they watched the Father separating His\nbeams of light, love, and glory from His beloved Son, they would better\nunderstand how offensive in His sight is sin.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 693.2}",
                "The worlds unfallen and the heavenly angels had watched with intense\ninterest as the conflict drew to its close. Satan and his confederacy of\nevil, the legions of apostasy, watched intently this great crisis in the\nwork of redemption. The powers of good and evil waited to see what\nanswer would come to Christ's thrice-repeated prayer. Angels had longed\nto bring relief to the divine sufferer, but this might not be. No way of\nescape was found for the Son of God. In this awful crisis, when\neverything was at stake, when the mysterious cup trembled in the hand of\nthe sufferer, the heavens opened, a light shone forth amid the stormy\ndarkness of the crisis hour, and the mighty angel who stands in God's\npresence, occupying the position from which Satan fell, came to the side\nof Christ. The angel came not to take the cup from Christ's hand, but to\nstrengthen Him to drink it, with the assurance of the Father's love. He\ncame to give power to the divine-human suppliant. He pointed Him to the\nopen heavens, telling Him of the souls that would be saved as the result\nof His sufferings. He assured Him that His Father is greater and more\npowerful than Satan, that His death would result in the utter\ndiscomfiture of Satan, and that the kingdom of this world would be given\nto the saints of the Most High. He told Him that He\u00c2\u00a0would see of the\ntravail of His soul, and be satisfied, for He would see a multitude of\nthe human race saved, eternally saved.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 693.3}",
                "Christ's agony did not cease, but His depression and discouragement left\nHim. The storm had in nowise abated, but He who was its object was\nstrengthened to meet its fury. He came forth calm and serene. A heavenly\npeace rested upon His bloodstained face. He had borne that which no\nhuman being could ever bear; for He had tasted the sufferings of death\nfor every man.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 694.1}",
                "The sleeping disciples had been suddenly awakened by the light\nsurrounding the Saviour. They saw the angel bending over their prostrate\nMaster. They saw him lift the Saviour's head upon his bosom, and point\ntoward heaven. They heard his voice, like sweetest music, speaking words\nof comfort and hope. The disciples recalled the scene upon the mount of\ntransfiguration. They remembered the glory that in the temple had\nencircled Jesus, and the voice of God that spoke from the cloud. Now\nthat same glory was again revealed, and they had no further fear for\ntheir Master. He was under the care of God; a mighty angel had been sent\nto protect Him. Again the disciples in their weariness yield to the\nstrange stupor that overpowers them. Again Jesus finds them\nsleeping.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 694.2}",
                "Looking sorrowfully upon them He says, \"Sleep on now, and take your\nrest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into\nthe hands of sinners.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 694.3}",
                "Even as He spoke these words, He heard the footsteps of the mob in\nsearch of Him, and said, \"Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand\nthat doth betray Me.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 694.4}",
                "No traces of His recent agony were visible as Jesus stepped forth to\nmeet His betrayer. Standing in advance of His disciples He said, \"Whom\nseek ye?\" They answered, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" Jesus replied, \"I am He.\"\nAs these words were spoken, the angel who had lately ministered to Jesus\nmoved between Him and the mob. A divine light illuminated the Saviour's\nface, and a dovelike form overshadowed Him. In the presence of this\ndivine glory, the murderous throng could not stand for a moment. They\nstaggered back. Priests, elders, soldiers, and even Judas, fell as dead\nmen to the ground.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 694.5}",
                "The angel withdrew, and the light faded away. Jesus had opportunity to\nescape, but He remained, calm and self-possessed. As one glorified He\nstood in the midst of that hardened band, now prostrate and helpless at\nHis feet. The disciples looked on, silent with wonder and awe.\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n694.6}",
                "But quickly the scene changed. The mob started up. The Roman soldiers,\nthe priests and Judas, gathered about Christ. They seemed ashamed of\ntheir weakness, and fearful that He would yet escape. Again the question\nwas asked by the Redeemer, \"Whom seek ye?\" They had had evidence that He\nwho stood before them was the Son of God, but they would not be\nconvinced. To the question, \"Whom seek ye?\" again they answered, \"Jesus\nof Nazareth.\" The Saviour then said, \"I have told you that I am He: if\ntherefore ye seek Me, let these go their way\"---pointing to the\ndisciples. He knew how weak was their faith, and He sought to shield\nthem from temptation and trial. For them He was ready to sacrifice\nHimself.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 695.1}",

To the pursuers of Jesus he had given a sign, saying,\n\"Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is He: hold Him fast.\"\u00c2\u00a0Matthew\n26:48. Now he pretends to have no part with them. Coming close to\u00c2\u00a0Jesus,\nhe takes His hand as a familiar friend. With the words, \"Hail, Master,\"\nhe kisses Him repeatedly, and appears to weep as if in sympathy with Him\nin His peril.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 695.2}",
                "Jesus said to him, \"Friend, wherefore art thou come?\" His voice trembled\nwith sorrow as He added, \"Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a\nkiss?\" This appeal should have aroused the conscience of the betrayer,\nand touched his stubborn heart; but honor, fidelity, and human\ntenderness had forsaken him. He stood bold and defiant, showing no\ndisposition to relent. He had given himself up to Satan, and he had no\npower to resist him. Jesus did not refuse the traitor's kiss.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 696.1}",
                "The mob grew bold as they saw Judas touch the person of Him who had so\nrecently been glorified before their eyes. They now laid hold of Jesus,\nand proceeded to bind those precious hands that had ever been employed\nin doing good.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 696.2}",

For the same power that had caused the mob to fall as dead men\ncould keep them helpless, until Jesus and His companions should escape.\nThey were disappointed and indignant as they saw the cords brought\nforward to bind the hands of Him whom they loved. Peter in his anger\nrashly drew his sword and tried to defend his Master, but he only cut\noff an ear of the high priest's servant. When Jesus saw what was done,\nHe released His hands, though held firmly by the Roman soldiers, and\nsaying, \"Suffer ye thus far,\" He touched the wounded ear, and it was\ninstantly made whole. He then said to Peter, \"Put up again thy sword\ninto his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the\nsword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall\npresently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?\"---a legion in\nplace of each one of the disciples. Oh, why, the disciples thought, does\nHe not save Himself and us? Answering their unspoken thought, He added,\n\"But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?\"\n\"The cup which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it?\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n696.3}",

It was therefore necessary to bring against Christ\ncharges\u00c2\u00a0that would be regarded as criminal by the Romans. An accusation\nmust also be found which would condemn Him in the eyes of the Jews. Not\na few among the priests and rulers had been convicted by Christ's\nteaching, and only fear of excommunication prevented them from\nconfessing Him. The priests well remembered the question of Nicodemus,\n\"Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he\ndoeth?\"\u00c2\u00a0John 7:51. This question had for the time broken up the council,\nand thwarted their plans. Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus were not\nnow to be summoned, but there were others who might dare to speak in\nfavor of justice. The trial must be so conducted as to unite the members\nof the Sanhedrin against Christ. There were two charges which the\npriests desired to maintain. If Jesus could be proved a blasphemer, He\nwould be condemned by the Jews. If convicted of sedition, it would\nsecure His condemnation by the Romans. The second charge Annas tried\nfirst to establish. He questioned Jesus concerning His disciples and His\ndoctrines, hoping the prisoner would say something that would give him\nmaterial upon which to work. He thought to draw out some statement to\nprove that He was seeking to establish a secret society, with the\npurpose of setting up a new kingdom. Then the priests could deliver Him\nto the Romans as a disturber of the peace and a creator of\ninsurrection.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 698.3}",
                "Christ read the priest's purpose as an open book. As if reading the\ninmost soul of His questioner, He denied that there was between Him and\nHis followers any secret bond of union, or that He gathered them\nsecretly and in the darkness to conceal His designs. He had no secrets\nin regard to His purposes or doctrines. \"I spake openly to the world,\"\nHe answered; \"I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither\nthe Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 699.1}",
                "The Saviour contrasted His own manner of work with the methods of His\naccusers. For months they had hunted Him, striving to entrap Him and\nbring Him before a secret tribunal, where they might obtain by perjury\nwhat it was impossible to gain by fair means. Now they were carrying out\ntheir purpose. The midnight seizure by a mob, the mockery and abuse\nbefore He was condemned, or even accused, was their manner of work, not\nHis. Their action was in violation of the law. Their own rules declared\nthat every man should be treated as innocent until proved guilty. By\ntheir own rules the priests stood condemned.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 699.2}",
                "Turning upon His questioner, Jesus said, \"Why askest thou Me?\" Had not\nthe priests and rulers sent spies to watch His movements, and report His\nevery word? Had not these been present at every gathering\u00c2\u00a0of the people,\nand carried to the priests information of all His sayings and doings?\n\"Ask them which heard Me, what I have said unto them,\" replied Jesus;\n\"behold, they know what I said.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 699.3}",
                "Annas was silenced by the decision of the answer. Fearing that Christ\nwould say something regarding his course of action that he would prefer\nto keep covered up, he said nothing more to Him at this time. One of his\nofficers, filled with wrath as he saw Annas silenced, struck Jesus on\nthe face, saying, \"Answerest Thou the high priest so?\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 700.1}",
                "Christ calmly replied, \"If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil:\nbut if well, why smitest thou Me?\" He spoke no burning words of\nretaliation. His calm answer came from a heart sinless, patient, and\ngentle, that would not be provoked.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 700.2}",
                "Christ suffered keenly under abuse and insult. At the hands of the\nbeings whom He had created, and for whom He was making an infinite\nsacrifice, He received every indignity. And He suffered in proportion to\nthe perfection of His holiness and His hatred of sin. His trial by men\nwho acted as fiends was to Him a perpetual sacrifice. To be surrounded\nby human beings under the control of Satan was revolting to Him. And He\nknew that in a moment, by the flashing forth of His divine power, He\ncould lay His cruel tormentors in the dust. This made the trial the\nharder to bear.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 700.3}",

They\nexpected Him, by one flash of overmastering will, to change the current\nof men's thoughts, and force from them an acknowledgment of His\nsupremacy. Thus, they believed, He was to secure His own exaltation, and\ngratify their ambitious hopes. Thus when Christ was treated with\ncontempt, there came to Him a strong temptation to manifest His divine\ncharacter. By a word, by a look, He could compel His persecutors to\nconfess that He was Lord above kings and rulers, priests and temple. But\nit was His difficult task to keep to the position He had chosen as one\nwith humanity.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 700.4}",

How easily could the angels, beholding the shameful scene\nof the trial of Christ, have testified their indignation by consuming\nthe adversaries of God! But they were not commanded to do this. He who\ncould have doomed His enemies to death bore with\u00c2\u00a0their cruelty. His love\nfor His Father, and His pledge, made from the foundation of the world,\nto become the Sin Bearer, led Him to endure uncomplainingly the coarse\ntreatment of those He came to save. It was a part of His mission to\nbear, in His humanity, all the taunts and abuse that men could heap upon\nHim. The only hope of humanity was in this submission of Christ to all\nthat He could endure from the hands and hearts of men.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 700.5}",

It was necessary that there should be the form of\na legal trial. This the authorities were determined to hasten. They knew\nthe regard in which Jesus was held by the people, and feared that if the\narrest were noised abroad, a rescue would be attempted. Again, if the\ntrial and execution were not brought about at once, there would be a\nweek's delay on account of the celebration of the Passover. This might\ndefeat their plans. In securing the condemnation of Jesus they depended\nlargely upon the clamor of the mob, many of them the rabble of\nJerusalem. Should there be a week's delay, the excitement would abate,\nand a reaction would be likely to set in. The better part of the people\nwould be aroused in Christ's favor; many would come forward with\ntestimony in His vindication, bringing to light the mighty works He had\ndone. This would excite popular indignation against the Sanhedrin. Their\nproceedings would be condemned, and Jesus would be set free, to receive\nnew homage from the multitudes. The priests and rulers therefore\ndetermined that before their purpose could become known, Jesus should be\ndelivered into the hands of the Romans.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 703.1}",

Caiaphas belonged\nto the Sadducees, some of whom were now the most desperate enemies of\nJesus. He himself, though wanting in force of character, was fully as\nsevere, heartless, and unscrupulous as was Annas. He would leave no\nmeans untried to destroy Jesus. It was now early morning, and very dark;\nby the light of torches and lanterns the armed band with their prisoner\nproceeded to the high priest's palace. Here, while the members of the\nSanhedrin were coming together, Annas and Caiaphas again questioned\nJesus, but without success.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 703.2}",
                "When the council had assembled in the judgment hall, Caiaphas took his\nseat as presiding officer. On either side were the judges, and those\nspecially interested in the trial. The Roman soldiers were stationed\non\u00c2\u00a0the platform below the throne. At the foot of the throne stood Jesus.\nUpon Him the gaze of the whole multitude was fixed. The excitement was\nintense. Of all the throng He alone was calm and serene. The very\natmosphere surrounding Him seemed pervaded by a holy influence.\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n703.3}",

The eagerness of the people to\nhear the Saviour, and their apparent readiness to accept His teachings,\nhad aroused the bitter jealousy of the high priest. But as Caiaphas now\nlooked upon the prisoner, he was struck with admiration for His noble\nand dignified bearing. A conviction came over him that this Man was akin\nto God. The next instant he scornfully banished the thought.\nImmediately\u00c2\u00a0his voice was heard in sneering, haughty tones demanding\nthat Jesus work one of His mighty miracles before them. But his words\nfell upon the Saviour's ears as though He heard them not. The people\ncompared the excited and malignant deportment of Annas and Caiaphas with\nthe calm, majestic bearing of Jesus. Even in the minds of that hardened\nmultitude arose the question, Is this man of godlike presence to be\ncondemned as a criminal?\u00c2\u00a0{DA 704.1}",
                "Caiaphas, perceiving the influence that was obtaining, hastened the\ntrial. The enemies of Jesus were in great perplexity. They were bent on\nsecuring His condemnation, but how to accomplish this they knew not. The\nmembers of the council were divided between the Pharisees and the\nSadducees. There was bitter animosity and controversy between them;\ncertain disputed points they dared not approach for fear of a quarrel.\nWith a few words Jesus could have excited their prejudices against each\nother, and thus have averted their wrath from Himself. Caiaphas knew\nthis, and he wished to avoid stirring up a contention. There were plenty\nof witnesses to prove that Christ had denounced the priests and scribes,\nthat He had called them hypocrites and murderers; but this testimony it\nwas not expedient to bring forward. The Sadducees in their sharp\ncontentions with the Pharisees had used to them similar language. And\nsuch testimony would have no weight with the Romans, who were themselves\ndisgusted with the pretensions of the Pharisees. There was abundant\nevidence that Jesus had disregarded the traditions of the Jews, and had\nspoken irreverently of many of their ordinances; but in regard to\ntradition the Pharisees and Sadducees were at swords' points; and this\nevidence also would have no weight with the Romans. Christ's enemies\ndared not accuse Him of Sabbathbreaking, lest an examination should\nreveal the character of His work. If His miracles of healing were\nbrought to light, the very object of the priests would be defeated.\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n705.1}",

                "Early in His ministry Christ had said, \"Destroy this temple, and in\nthree days I will raise it up.\" In the figurative language of prophecy,\nHe had thus foretold His own death and resurrection. \"He spake of the\ntemple of His body.\"\u00c2\u00a0John 2:19, 21. These words the Jews had understood\nin a literal sense, as referring to the temple at Jerusalem. Of all that\nChrist had said, the priests could find nothing to use against Him\u00c2\u00a0save\nthis. By misstating these words they hoped to gain an advantage. The\nRomans had engaged in rebuilding and embellishing the temple, and they\ntook great pride in it; any contempt shown to it would be sure to excite\ntheir indignation. Here Romans and Jews, Pharisees and Sadducees, could\nmeet; for all held the temple in great veneration. On this point two\nwitnesses were found whose testimony was not so contradictory as that of\nthe others had been. One of them, who had been bribed to accuse Jesus,\ndeclared, \"This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and\nto build it in three days.\" Thus Christ's words were misstated. If they\nhad been reported exactly as He spoke them, they would not have secured\nHis condemnation even by the Sanhedrin. Had Jesus been a mere man, as\nthe Jews claimed, His declaration would only have indicated an\nunreasonable, boastful spirit, but could not have been construed into\nblasphemy. Even as misrepresented by the false witnesses, His words\ncontained nothing which would be regarded by the Romans as a crime\nworthy of death.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 705.3}",
                "Patiently Jesus listened to the conflicting testimonies. No word did He\nutter in self-defense. At last His accusers were entangled, confused,\nand maddened. The trial was making no headway; it seemed that their\nplottings were to fail. Caiaphas was desperate. One last resort\nremained; Christ must be forced to condemn Himself. The high priest\nstarted from the judgment seat, his face contorted with passion, his\nvoice and demeanor plainly indicating that were it in his power he would\nstrike down the prisoner before him. \"Answerest Thou nothing?\" he\nexclaimed; \"what is it which these witness against Thee?\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 706.1}",

Again the cock crew. Peter heard it then, and he remembered\nthe words of Jesus, \"Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny Me\nthrice.\"\u00c2\u00a0Mark 14:30.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 712.3}",
                "While the degrading oaths were fresh upon Peter's lips, and the\nshrill\u00c2\u00a0crowing of the cock was still ringing in his ears, the Saviour\nturned from the frowning judges, and looked full upon His poor disciple.\nAt the same time Peter's eyes were drawn to his Master. In that gentle\ncountenance he read deep pity and sorrow, but there was no anger\nthere.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 712.4}",
                "The sight of that pale, suffering face, those quivering lips, that look\nof compassion and forgiveness, pierced his heart like an arrow.\nConscience was aroused. Memory was active. Peter called to mind his\npromise of a few short hours before that he would go with his Lord to\nprison and to death. He remembered his grief when the Saviour told him\nin the upper chamber that he would deny his Lord thrice that same night.\nPeter had just declared that he knew not Jesus, but he now realized with\nbitter grief how well his Lord knew him, and how accurately He had read\nhis heart, the falseness of which was unknown even to himself.\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n713.1}",
                "A tide of memories rushed over him. The Saviour's tender mercy, His\nkindness and long-suffering, His gentleness and patience toward His\nerring disciples,---all was remembered. He recalled the caution, \"Simon,\nbehold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:\nbut I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.\"\u00c2\u00a0Luke 22:31, 32. He\nreflected with horror upon his own ingratitude, his falsehood, his\nperjury. Once more he looked at his Master, and saw a sacrilegious hand\nraised to smite Him in the face. Unable longer to endure the scene, he\nrushed, heartbroken, from the hall.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 713.2}",
                "He pressed on in solitude and darkness, he knew not and cared not\nwhither. At last he found himself in Gethsemane. The scene of a few\nhours before came vividly to his mind. The suffering face of his Lord,\nstained with bloody sweat and convulsed with anguish, rose before him.\nHe remembered with bitter remorse that Jesus had wept and agonized in\nprayer alone, while those who should have united with Him in that trying\nhour were sleeping. He remembered His solemn charge, \"Watch and pray,\nthat ye enter not into temptation.\"\u00c2\u00a0Matthew 26:41. He witnessed again\nthe scene in the judgment hall. It was torture to his bleeding heart to\nknow that he had added the heaviest burden to the Saviour's humiliation\nand grief. On the very spot where Jesus had poured out His soul in agony\nto His Father, Peter fell upon his face, and wished that he might\ndie.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 713.3}",
                "It was in sleeping when Jesus bade him watch and pray that Peter had\nprepared the way for his great sin. All the disciples, by sleeping\u00c2\u00a0in\nthat critical hour, sustained a great loss. Christ knew the fiery ordeal\nthrough which they were to pass. He knew how Satan would work to\nparalyze their senses that they might be unready for the trial.\nTherefore it was that He gave them warning. Had those hours in the\ngarden been spent in watching and prayer, Peter would not have been left\nto depend upon his own feeble strength. He would not have denied his\nLord. Had the disciples watched with Christ in His agony, they would\nhave been prepared to behold His suffering upon the cross. They would\nhave understood in some degree the nature of His overpowering anguish.\nThey would have been able to recall His words that foretold His\nsufferings, His death, and His resurrection. Amid the gloom of the most\ntrying hour, some rays of hope would have lighted up the darkness and\nsustained their faith.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 713.4}",
                "As soon as it was day, the Sanhedrin again assembled, and again Jesus\nwas brought into the council room. He had declared Himself the Son of\nGod, and they had construed His words into a charge against Him. But\nthey could not condemn Him on this, for many of them had not been\npresent at the night session, and they had not heard His words. And they\nknew that the Roman tribunal would find in them nothing worthy of death.\nBut if from His own lips they could all hear those words repeated, their\nobject might be gained. His claim to the Messiahship they might construe\ninto a seditious political claim.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 714.1}",
                "\"Art Thou the Christ?\" they said, \"tell us.\" But Christ remained silent.\nThey continued to ply Him with questions. At last in tones of mournful\npathos He answered, \"If I tell you, ye will not believe; and if I also\nask you, ye will not answer Me, nor let Me go.\" But that they might be\nleft without excuse He added the solemn warning, \"Hereafter shall the\nSon of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 714.2}",
                "\"Art Thou then the Son of God?\" they asked with one voice. He said unto\nthem, \"Ye say that I am.\" They cried out, \"What need we any further\nwitness? for we ourselves have heard of His own mouth.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 714.3}",

If their\narguments\u00c2\u00a0were weak, and failed to silence His voice, they had other\nweapons, such as in all ages have been used to silence\nheretics,---suffering, and violence, and death.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 714.5}",
                "When the condemnation of Jesus was pronounced by the judges, a satanic\nfury took possession of the people. The roar of voices was like that of\nwild beasts. The crowd made a rush toward Jesus, crying, He is guilty,\nput Him to death! Had it not been for the Roman soldiers, Jesus would\nnot have lived to be nailed to the cross of Calvary. He would have been\ntorn in pieces before His judges, had not Roman authority interfered,\nand by force of arms restrained the violence of the mob.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 715.1}",
                "Heathen men were angry at the brutal treatment of one against whom\nnothing had been proved. The Roman officers declared that the Jews in\npronouncing condemnation upon Jesus were infringing upon the Roman\npower, and that it was even against the Jewish law to condemn a man to\ndeath upon his own testimony. This intervention brought a momentary lull\nin the proceedings; but the Jewish leaders were dead alike to pity and\nto shame.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 715.2}",

An old garment was thrown over\nHis head, and His persecutors struck Him in the face, saying, \"Prophesy\nunto us, Thou Christ, Who is he that smote Thee?\" When the garment was\nremoved, one poor wretch spat in His face.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 715.3}",

                "The history of Judas presents the sad ending of a life that might have\nbeen honored of God. Had Judas died before his last journey to Jerusalem\nhe would have been regarded as a man worthy of a place among the twelve,\nand one who would be greatly missed. The abhorrence which has followed\nhim through the centuries would not have existed but for the attributes\nrevealed at the close of his history. But it was for a purpose that his\ncharacter was laid open to the world. It was to be a warning to all who,\nlike him, should betray sacred trusts.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 716.1}",
                "A little before the Passover, Judas had renewed his contract with the\npriests to deliver Jesus into their hands. Then it was arranged that the\nSaviour should be taken at one of His resorts for meditation and prayer.\nSince the feast at the house of Simon, Judas had had opportunity to\nreflect upon the deed which he had covenanted to perform, but his\npurpose was unchanged. For thirty pieces of silver---the price of a\nslave---he sold the Lord of glory to ignominy and death.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 716.2}",
                "Judas had naturally a strong love for money; but he had not always been\ncorrupt enough to do such a deed as this. He had fostered the evil\nspirit of avarice until it had become the ruling motive of his life. The\nlove of mammon overbalanced his love for Christ. Through becoming the\nslave of one vice he gave himself to Satan, to be driven to any lengths\nin sin.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 716.3}",
                "Judas had joined the disciples when multitudes were following Christ.\nThe Saviour's teaching moved their hearts as they hung entranced upon\nHis words, spoken in the synagogue, by the seaside, upon the\nmount.\u00c2\u00a0Judas saw the sick, the lame, the blind, flock to Jesus from the\ntowns and cities. He saw the dying laid at His feet. He witnessed the\nSaviour's mighty works in healing the sick, casting out devils, and\nraising the dead. He felt in his own person the evidence of Christ's\npower. He recognized the teaching of Christ as superior to all that he\nhad ever heard. He loved the Great Teacher, and desired to be with Him.\nHe felt a desire to be changed in character and life, and he hoped to\nexperience this through connecting himself with Jesus. The Saviour did\nnot repulse Judas. He gave him a place among the twelve. He trusted him\nto do the work of an evangelist. He endowed him with power to heal the\nsick and to cast out devils. But Judas did not come to the point of\nsurrendering himself fully to Christ. He did not give up his worldly\nambition or his love of money. While he accepted the position of a\nminister of Christ, he did not bring himself under the divine molding.\nHe felt that he could retain his own judgment and opinions, and he\ncultivated a disposition to criticize and accuse.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 716.4}",
                "Judas was highly regarded by the disciples, and had great influence over\nthem. He himself had a high opinion of his own qualifications, and\nlooked upon his brethren as greatly inferior to him in judgment and\nability. They did not see their opportunities, he thought, and take\nadvantage of circumstances. The church would never prosper with such\nshortsighted men as leaders. Peter was impetuous; he would move without\nconsideration. John, who was treasuring up the truths that fell from\nChrist's lips, was looked upon by Judas as a poor financier. Matthew,\nwhose training had taught him accuracy in all things, was very\nparticular in regard to honesty, and he was ever contemplating the words\nof Christ, and became so absorbed in them that, as Judas thought, he\ncould not be trusted to do sharp, far-seeing business. Thus Judas summed\nup all the disciples, and flattered himself that the church would often\nbe brought into perplexity and embarrassment if it were not for his\nability as a manager. Judas regarded himself as the capable one, who\ncould not be overreached. In his own estimation he was an honor to the\ncause, and as such he always represented himself.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 717.1}",
                "Judas was blinded to his own weakness of character, and Christ placed\nhim where he would have an opportunity to see and correct this. As\ntreasurer for the disciples, he was called upon to provide for the needs\nof the little company, and to relieve the necessities of the poor. When\nin the Passover chamber Jesus said to him, \"That thou doest, do quickly\"\n(John 13:27), the disciples thought He had bidden him\u00c2\u00a0buy what was\nneeded for the feast, or give something to the poor. In ministering to\nothers, Judas might have developed an unselfish spirit. But while\nlistening daily to the lessons of Christ and witnessing His unselfish\nlife, Judas indulged his covetous disposition. The small sums that came\ninto his hands were a continual temptation. Often when he did a little\nservice for Christ, or devoted time to religious purposes, he paid\nhimself out of this meager fund. In his own eyes these pretexts served\nto excuse his action; but in God's sight he was a thief.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 717.2}",
                "Christ's oft-repeated statement that His kingdom was not of this world\noffended Judas. He had marked out a line upon which he expected Christ\nto work. He had planned that John the Baptist should be delivered from\nprison. But lo, John was left to be beheaded. And Jesus, instead of\nasserting His royal right and avenging the death of John, retired with\nHis disciples into a country place. Judas wanted more aggressive\nwarfare. He thought that if Jesus would not prevent the disciples from\ncarrying out their schemes, the work would be more successful. He marked\nthe increasing enmity of the Jewish leaders, and saw their challenge\nunheeded when they demanded from Christ a sign from heaven. His heart\nwas open to unbelief, and the enemy supplied thoughts of questioning and\nrebellion. Why did Jesus dwell so much upon that which was discouraging?\nWhy did He predict trial and persecution for Himself and for His\ndisciples? The prospect of having a high place in the new kingdom had\nled Judas to espouse the cause of Christ. Were his hopes to be\ndisappointed? Judas had not decided that Jesus was not the Son of God;\nbut he was questioning, and seeking to find some explanation of His\nmighty works.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 718.1}",
                "Notwithstanding the Saviour's own teaching, Judas was continually\nadvancing the idea that Christ would reign as king in Jerusalem. At the\nfeeding of the five thousand he tried to bring this about. On this\noccasion Judas assisted in distributing the food to the hungry\nmultitude. He had an opportunity to see the benefit which it was in his\npower to impart to others. He felt the satisfaction that always comes in\nservice to God. He helped to bring the sick and suffering from among the\nmultitude to Christ. He saw what relief, what joy and gladness, come to\nhuman hearts through the healing power of the Restorer. He might have\ncomprehended the methods of Christ. But he was blinded by his own\nselfish desires. Judas was first to take advantage of the enthusiasm\nexcited by the miracle of the loaves. It was he who set on foot\nthe\u00c2\u00a0project to take Christ by force and make Him king. His hopes were\nhigh. His disappointment was bitter.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 718.2}",
                "Christ's discourse in the synagogue concerning the bread of life was the\nturning point in the history of Judas. He heard the words, \"Except ye\neat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in\nyou.\"\u00c2\u00a0John 6:53. He saw that Christ was offering spiritual rather than\nworldly good. He regarded himself as farsighted, and thought he could\nsee that Jesus would have no honor, and that He could bestow no high\nposition upon His followers. He determined not to unite himself so\nclosely to Christ but that he could draw away. He would watch. And he\ndid watch.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 719.1}",
                "From that time he expressed doubts that confused the disciples. He\nintroduced controversies and misleading sentiments, repeating the\narguments urged by the scribes and Pharisees against the claims of\nChrist. All the little and large troubles and crosses, the difficulties\nand the apparent hindrances to the advancement of the gospel, Judas\ninterpreted as evidences against its truthfulness. He would introduce\ntexts of Scripture that had no connection with the truths Christ was\npresenting. These texts, separated from their connection, perplexed the\ndisciples, and increased the discouragement that was constantly pressing\nupon them. Yet all this was done by Judas in such a way as to make it\nappear that he was conscientious. And while the disciples were searching\nfor evidence to confirm the words of the Great Teacher, Judas would lead\nthem almost imperceptibly on another track. Thus in a very religious,\nand apparently wise, way he was presenting matters in a different light\nfrom that in which Jesus had given them, and attaching to His words a\nmeaning that He had not conveyed. His suggestions were constantly\nexciting an ambitious desire for temporal preferment, and thus turning\nthe disciples from the important things they should have considered. The\ndissension as to which of them should be greatest was generally excited\nby Judas.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 719.2}",

If such men as this ruler could be connected with the believers,\nthey would help sustain Christ's cause. If Judas were only received as a\ncounselor, he thought, he could suggest many plans for the advantage of\nthe little church. His principles and methods would differ somewhat from\nChrist's, but in these things he thought himself wiser than Christ.\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n719.3}",
                "In all that Christ said to His disciples, there was something with\nwhich, in heart, Judas disagreed. Under his influence the leaven of\ndisaffection was fast doing its work. The disciples did not see the real\nagency in all this; but Jesus saw that Satan was communicating his\nattributes to Judas, and thus opening up a channel through which to\ninfluence the other disciples. This, a year before the betrayal, Christ\ndeclared. \"Have not I chosen you twelve,\" He said, \"and one of you is a\ndevil?\"\u00c2\u00a0John 6:70.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 720.1}",
                "Yet Judas made no open opposition, nor seemed to question the Saviour's\nlessons. He made no outward murmur until the time of the feast in\nSimon's house. When Mary anointed the Saviour's feet, Judas manifested\nhis covetous disposition. At the reproof from Jesus his very spirit\nseemed turned to gall. Wounded pride and desire for revenge broke down\nthe barriers, and the greed so long indulged held him in control. This\nwill be the experience of everyone who persists in tampering with sin.\nThe elements of depravity that are not resisted and overcome, respond to\nSatan's temptation, and the soul is led captive at his will.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 720.2}",
                "But Judas was not yet wholly hardened. Even after he had twice pledged\nhimself to betray the Saviour, there was opportunity for repentance. At\nthe Passover supper Jesus proved His divinity by revealing the traitor's\npurpose. He tenderly included Judas in the ministry to the disciples.\nBut the last appeal of love was unheeded. Then the case of Judas was\ndecided, and the feet that Jesus had washed went forth to the betrayer's\nwork.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 720.3}",
                "Judas reasoned that if Jesus was to be crucified, the event must come to\npass. His own act in betraying the Saviour would not change the result.\nIf Jesus was not to die, it would only force Him to deliver Himself. At\nall events, Judas would gain something by his treachery. He counted that\nhe had made a sharp bargain in betraying his Lord.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 720.4}",
                "Judas did not, however, believe that Christ would permit Himself to be\narrested. In betraying Him, it was his purpose to teach Him a lesson. He\nintended to play a part that would make the Saviour careful thenceforth\nto treat him with due respect. But Judas knew not that he was giving\nChrist up to death. How often, as the Saviour taught in parables, the\nscribes and Pharisees had been carried away with His striking\nillustrations! How often they had pronounced judgment against\nthemselves! Often when the truth was brought home to their hearts, they\nhad been filled with rage, and had taken up stones to cast at Him;\u00c2\u00a0but\nagain and again He had made His escape.

                "Judas decided to put the matter to the test. If Jesus really was the\nMessiah, the people, for whom He had done so much, would rally about\nHim, and would proclaim Him king. This would forever settle many minds\nthat were now in uncertainty. Judas would have the credit of having\nplaced the king on David's throne.

At every movement he looked for Him to surprise His\nenemies, by appearing before them as the Son of God, and setting at\nnought all their plots and power.

They hoped to\nimpress Pilate with a sense of their importance, and thus lead him to\naccede to their request without going through many preliminaries.

Should he refuse to give\nJesus into their hands, a tumult would be raised, and this he feared to\nmeet. When he heard that Christ was from Galilee, he decided to send Him\nto Herod, the ruler of that province, who was then in Jerusalem. By this\ncourse, Pilate thought to shift the responsibility of the trial from\nhimself to Herod. He also thought this a good opportunity to heal an old\nquarrel between himself and Herod.

I am anxious to see that Thy widespread fame has not been belied.\nJesus did not respond, and Herod still continued to urge: If Thou canst\nwork miracles for others, work them now for Thine own good, and it will\nserve Thee a good purpose. Again he commanded, Show us a sign that Thou\nhast the power with which rumor hath accredited Thee. But Christ was as\none who heard and saw not. The Son of God had taken upon Himself man's\nnature.

This custom was of pagan\ninvention; there was not a shadow of justice in it, but it was greatly\nprized by the Jews. The Roman authorities at this time held a prisoner\nnamed Barabbas, who was under sentence of death. This man had claimed to\nbe the Messiah. He claimed authority to establish a different order of\nthings, to set the world right. Under satanic delusion he claimed that\nwhatever he could obtain by theft and robbery was his own. He had done\nwonderful things through satanic agencies, he had gained a following\namong the people, and had excited sedition against the Roman government.\nUnder cover of religious enthusiasm he was a hardened and desperate\nvillain, bent on rebellion and cruelty. By giving the people a choice\nbetween this man and the innocent Saviour, Pilate thought to arouse them\nto a sense of justice.

One\nstain upon His human life, one failure of His humanity to endure the\nterrible test, and the Lamb of God would have been an imperfect\noffering, and the redemption of man a failure.

As their cruelty\ndegraded His torturers below humanity into the likeness of Satan, so did\nHis meekness and patience exalt Jesus above humanity, and prove His\nkinship to God. His abasement was the pledge of His exaltation.

Every feature expressed gentleness and resignation and the\ntenderest pity for His cruel foes. In His manner there was no cowardly\nweakness, but the strength and dignity of long-suffering. In striking\ncontrast was the prisoner at His side. Every line of the countenance of\nBarabbas proclaimed him the hardened ruffian that he was. The contrast\nspoke to every beholder.

Of\nall the opponents of the Roman rule, the Jews were most bitter. When it\nwas safe for them to do so, they were most tyrannical in enforcing their\nown national and religious requirements; but when they desired to bring\nabout some purpose of cruelty, they exalted the power of Caesar.

In the\nvast sea of upturned faces, His alone was peaceful. About His head a\nsoft light seemed to shine. Pilate said in his heart, He is a God.\nTurning to the multitude he declared, I am clear of His blood. Take ye\nHim, and crucify Him. But mark ye, priests and rulers, I pronounce Him a\njust man. May He whom He claims as His Father judge you and not me for\nthis day's work. Then to Jesus he said, Forgive me for this act; I\ncannot save You. And when he had again scourged Jesus, he delivered Him\nto be crucified.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 738.1}",
                "Pilate longed to deliver Jesus. But he saw that he could not do this,\nand yet retain his own position and honor. Rather than lose his worldly\npower, he chose to sacrifice an innocent life. How many, to escape loss\nor suffering, in like manner sacrifice principle. Conscience and duty\npoint one way, and self-interest points another. The current sets\nstrongly in the wrong direction, and he who compromises with evil is\nswept away into the thick darkness of guilt.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 738.2}",

He had endured the anguish of the betrayal, and had seen His\ndisciples forsake Him and flee. He had been taken to Annas, then to\nCaiaphas, and then to Pilate. From Pilate He had been sent to Herod,\nthen sent again to Pilate.

Again her heart would sink\nas she recalled the words in which He had foretold the very scenes that\nwere then taking place. As the thieves were bound to the cross, she\nlooked on with agonizing suspense. Would He who had given life to the\ndead suffer Himself to be crucified?

It read, \"Jesus of Nazareth the King of the\nJews.\" This inscription irritated the Jews. In Pilate's court they had\ncried, \"Crucify Him.\" \"We have no king but Caesar.\"\u00c2\u00a0John 19:15. They had\ndeclared that whoever should acknowledge any other king was a traitor.\nPilate wrote out the sentiment they had expressed. No offense was\nmentioned, except that Jesus was the King of the Jews. The inscription\nwas a virtual acknowledgment of the allegiance of the Jews to the Roman\npower. It declared that whoever might claim to be the King of Israel\nwould be judged by them worthy of death. The priests had overreached\nthemselves. When they were plotting the death of Christ, Caiaphas had\ndeclared it expedient that one man should die to save the nation. Now\ntheir hypocrisy was revealed.

He replied coldly, \"What I have written I\nhave written.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 745.3}",
                "A higher power than Pilate or the Jews had directed the placing of that\ninscription above the head of Jesus.

Thousands of people from all\nlands were then at Jerusalem, and the inscription declaring Jesus\nof\u00c2\u00a0Nazareth the Messiah would come to their notice.

They part My garments among\nthem, and cast lots upon My vesture.\"\u00c2\u00a0Psalm 22:16-18.

And Satan\nwith his angels, in human form, was present at the\u00c2\u00a0cross. The archfiend\nand his hosts were co-operating with the priests and rulers. The\nteachers of the people had stimulated the ignorant mob to pronounce\njudgment against One upon whom many of them had never looked, until\nurged to bear testimony against Him.

Never before was there such a\ngeneral knowledge of Jesus as when He hung upon the cross.

                "To Jesus in His agony on the cross there came one gleam of comfort. It\nwas the prayer of the penitent thief. Both the men who were crucified\nwith Jesus had at first railed upon Him; and one under his suffering\nonly became more desperate and defiant. But not so with his companion.\nThis man was not a hardened criminal; he had been led astray by evil\nassociations, but he was less guilty than many of those who stood beside\nthe cross reviling the Saviour. He had seen and heard Jesus, and had\nbeen convicted by His teaching, but he had been turned away from Him by\nthe priests and rulers. Seeking to stifle conviction, he had plunged\ndeeper and deeper into sin, until he was arrested, tried as a criminal,\nand condemned to die on the cross. In the judgment hall and on the way\nto Calvary he had been in company with Jesus. He had heard Pilate\ndeclare, \"I find no fault in Him.\"\u00c2\u00a0John 19:4. He had marked His\u00c2\u00a0godlike\nbearing, and His pitying forgiveness of His tormentors. On the cross he\nsees the many great religionists shoot out the tongue with scorn, and\nridicule the Lord Jesus. He sees the wagging heads. He hears the\nupbraiding speeches taken up by his companion in guilt: \"If Thou be\nChrist, save Thyself and us.\" Among the passers-by he hears many\ndefending Jesus. He hears them repeat His words, and tell of His works.\nThe conviction comes back to him that this is the Christ. Turning to his\nfellow criminal he says, \"Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the\nsame condemnation?\" The dying thieves have no longer anything to fear\nfrom man. But upon one of them presses the conviction that there is a\nGod to fear, a future to cause him to tremble. And now, all sin-polluted\nas it is, his life history is about to close. \"And we indeed justly,\" he\nmoans; \"for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this Man hath\ndone nothing amiss.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 749.3}",
                "There is no question now. There are no doubts, no reproaches. When\ncondemned for his crime, the thief had become hopeless and despairing;\nbut strange, tender thoughts now spring up. He calls to mind all he has\nheard of Jesus, how He has healed the sick and pardoned sin. He has\nheard the words of those who believed in Jesus and followed Him weeping.\nHe has seen and read the title above the Saviour's head. He has heard\nthe passers-by repeat it, some with grieved, quivering lips, others with\njesting and mockery. The Holy Spirit illuminates his mind, and little by\nlittle the chain of evidence is joined together. In Jesus, bruised,\nmocked, and hanging upon the cross, he sees the Lamb of God, that taketh\naway the sin of the world. Hope is mingled with anguish in his voice as\nthe helpless, dying soul casts himself upon a dying Saviour. \"Lord,\nremember me,\" he cries, \"when Thou comest into Thy kingdom.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 750.1}",

With longing heart He has listened for some\nexpression of faith from His disciples. He has heard only the mournful\nwords, \"We trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed\nIsrael.\" How grateful then to the Saviour was the utterance of faith and\nlove from the dying thief! While the leading Jews deny Him, and even the\ndisciples doubt His divinity, the poor thief, upon the\u00c2\u00a0brink of\neternity, calls Jesus Lord. Many were ready to call Him Lord when He\nwrought miracles, and after He had risen from the grave; but none\nacknowledged Him as He hung dying upon the cross save the penitent thief\nwho was saved at the eleventh hour.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 750.3}",

To the penitent\nthief came the perfect peace of acceptance with God. Christ in His\nhumiliation was glorified. He who in all other eyes appeared to be\nconquered was a Conqueror. He was acknowledged as the Sin Bearer. Men\nmay exercise power over His human body. They may pierce the holy temples\nwith the crown of thorns. They may strip from Him His raiment, and\nquarrel over its division. But they cannot rob Him of His power to\nforgive sins. In dying He bears testimony to His own divinity and to the\nglory of the Father. His ear is not heavy that it cannot hear, neither\nHis arm shortened that it cannot save.

Thus was fulfilled the\nscripture, \"He was numbered with the transgressors.\"\u00c2\u00a0Isaiah 53:12. But\nthe full meaning of their act the priests did not see. As Jesus,\ncrucified with the thieves, was placed \"in the midst,\" so His cross was\nplaced in the midst of a world lying in sin.

                "As the eyes of Jesus wandered over the multitude about Him, one figure\narrested His attention. At the foot of the cross stood His mother,\nsupported by the disciple John. She could not endure to remain away from\nher Son; and John, knowing that the end was near, had brought her again\nto the cross. In His dying hour, Christ remembered His mother. Looking\ninto her grief-stricken face and then upon John, He said to her, \"Woman,\nbehold thy son!\" then to John, \"Behold thy mother!\" John understood\nChrist's words, and accepted the trust. He at once took Mary to his\nhome, and from that hour cared for her tenderly. O pitiful, loving\nSaviour; amid all His physical pain and mental anguish, He had a\nthoughtful care for His mother! He had no money with which to provide\nfor her comfort; but He was enshrined in the heart of John, and He gave\nHis mother to him as a precious legacy. Thus He provided for her that\nwhich she most needed,---the tender sympathy of one who loved her\nbecause she loved Jesus.

The\nsame spirit will be seen in every disciple of our Lord. Those who follow\nChrist will feel that it is a part of their religion to respect and\nprovide for their parents.

It was not the dread of death that weighed upon Him.\nIt was not the pain and ignominy of the cross that caused His\ninexpressible agony. Christ was the prince of sufferers; but His\nsuffering was from a sense of the malignity of sin, a knowledge\nthat\u00c2\u00a0through familiarity with evil, man had become blinded to its\nenormity. Christ saw how deep is the hold of sin upon the human heart,\nhow few would be willing to break from its power.

He\nsays, \"One of the soldiers with a spear pierced His side, and forthwith\ncame there out blood and water. And he that saw it bare record, and his\nrecord is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might\nbelieve. For these things were done, that the scripture should be\nfulfilled, A bone of Him shall not be broken. And again another\nscripture saith, They shall look on Him whom they pierced.\"\u00c2\u00a0John\n19:34-37.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 771.4}",
                "After the resurrection the priests and rulers circulated the report that\nChrist did not die upon the cross, that He merely fainted, and was\nafterward revived. Another report affirmed that it was not a real body\nof flesh and bone, but the likeness of a body, that was laid in the\ntomb. The action of the Roman soldiers disproves these falsehoods. They\nbroke not His legs, because He was already dead. To satisfy the priests,\nthey pierced His side. Had not life been already extinct, this wound\nwould have caused instant death.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 772.1}",
                "But it was not the spear thrust, it was not the pain of the cross, that\ncaused the death of Jesus. That cry, uttered \"with a loud voice\"\n(Matthew 27:50;\u00c2\u00a0Luke 23:46), at the moment of death, the stream of blood\nand water that flowed from His side, declared that He died of a broken\nheart.

Overwhelmed with sorrow, they\ndid not recall His words foretelling this very scene. Nothing that He\nhad said now gave them comfort. They saw only the cross and its bleeding\nVictim. The future seemed dark with despair. Their faith in Jesus had\nperished; but never had they loved their Lord as now.

Treason against the Roman government was the crime for\nwhich Jesus was condemned, and persons put to death for this offense\nwere consigned to a burial ground especially provided for such\ncriminals. The disciple John with the women from Galilee had remained at\nthe cross. They could not leave the body of their Lord to be handled by\nthe unfeeling soldiers, and buried in a dishonored grave. Yet they could\nnot prevent it. They could obtain no favors from the Jewish authorities,\nand they had no influence with Pilate.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 772.4}",

                "Joseph went boldly to Pilate, and begged from him the body of Jesus. For\nthe first time, Pilate learned that Jesus was really dead. Conflicting\nreports had reached him in regard to the events attending the\ncrucifixion, but the knowledge of Christ's death had been purposely kept\nfrom him. Pilate had been warned by the priests and rulers against\ndeception by Christ's disciples in regard to His body. Upon hearing\nJoseph's request, he therefore sent for the centurion who had charge at\nthe cross, and learned for a certainty of the death of Jesus. He also\ndrew from him an account of the scenes of Calvary, confirming the\ntestimony of Joseph.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 773.2}",

The most\nhonored in all Jerusalem could not have been shown more respect in\ndeath.

                "Neither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly accepted the Saviour while He\nwas living. They knew that such a step would exclude them from the\nSanhedrin, and they hoped to protect Him by their influence in its\ncouncils. For a time they had seemed to succeed; but the wily priests,\nseeing their favor to Christ, had thwarted their plans. In their absence\nJesus had been condemned and delivered to be crucified. Now that He was\ndead, they no longer concealed their attachment to Him. While the\ndisciples feared to show themselves openly as His followers,\u00c2\u00a0Joseph and\nNicodemus came boldly to their aid. The help of these rich and honored\nmen was greatly needed at this time.

Joseph owned a new tomb, hewn in a\nrock. This he was reserving for himself; but it was near Calvary, and he\nnow prepared it for Jesus. The body, together with the spices brought by\nNicodemus, was carefully wrapped in a linen sheet, and the Redeemer was\nborne to the tomb. There the three disciples straightened the mangled\nlimbs, and folded the bruised hands upon the pulseless breast. The\nGalilean women came to see that all had been done that could be done for\nthe lifeless form of their beloved Teacher. Then they saw the heavy\nstone rolled against the entrance of the tomb, and the Saviour was left\nat rest. The women were last at the cross, and last at the tomb of\nChrist.

                "That was a never-to-be-forgotten Sabbath to the sorrowing disciples, and\nalso to the priests, rulers, scribes, and people. At the setting of the\nsun on the evening of the preparation day the trumpets sounded,\nsignifying that the Sabbath had begun. The Passover was observed as it\nhad been for centuries, while He to whom it pointed had been slain by\nwicked hands, and lay in Joseph's tomb. On the Sabbath the courts of the\ntemple were filled with worshipers. The high priest from Golgotha was\nthere, splendidly robed in his sacerdotal garments. White-turbaned\npriests, full of activity, performed their duties. But some present were\nnot at rest as the blood of bulls and goats was offered for sin. They\nwere not conscious that type had met antitype, that an infinite\nsacrifice had been made for the sins of the world. They knew not that\nthere was no further value in the performance of the ritual service. But\nnever before had that service been witnessed with such conflicting\nfeelings. The trumpets and musical instruments and the voices of the\nsingers were as loud and clear as usual. But a sense of strangeness\npervaded everything.\u00c2\u00a0One after another inquired about a strange event\nthat had taken place. Hitherto the most holy place had been sacredly\nguarded from intrusion. But now it was open to all eyes. The heavy veil\nof tapestry, made of pure linen, and beautifully wrought with gold,\nscarlet, and purple, was rent from top to bottom. The place where\nJehovah had met with the high priest, to communicate His glory, the\nplace that had been God's sacred audience chamber, lay open to every\neye,---a place no longer recognized by the Lord. With gloomy\npresentiments the priests ministered before the altar. The uncovering of\nthe sacred mystery of the most holy place filled them with dread of\ncoming calamity.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 774.2}",

Though searching with\ndifferent objects in view, all were convicted of the same truth,---that\nprophecy had been fulfilled in the events of the past few days, and that\nthe Crucified One was the world's Redeemer. Many who at that time united\nin the service never again took part in the paschal rites. Many even of\nthe priests were convicted of the true character of Jesus.

On that Sabbath, when Christ lay in the grave,\nNicodemus had opportunity for reflection. A clearer light now\nilluminated his mind, and the words which Jesus had spoken to him were\nno longer mysterious. He felt that he had lost much by not connecting\nhimself with the Saviour during His life. Now he recalled the events of\nCalvary. The prayer of Christ for His murderers and His answer to the\npetition of the dying thief spoke to the heart of the learned councilor.\nAgain he looked upon the Saviour in His agony; again he heard that last\ncry, \"It is finished,\" spoken like the words of a conqueror. Again he\nbeheld the reeling earth, the darkened heavens, the rent veil, the\nshivered rocks, and his faith was forever established. The very event\nthat destroyed\u00c2\u00a0the hopes of the disciples convinced Joseph and Nicodemus\nof the divinity of Jesus.

Upon this occasion those who were thought to\nshow indications of the leprosy were examined by the priests. Many were\nforced to hear their husbands, wives, or children pronounced leprous,\nand doomed to go forth from the shelter of their homes and the care of\ntheir friends, to warn off the stranger with the mournful cry, \"Unclean,\nunclean!\" The friendly hands of Jesus of Nazareth, that never refused to\ntouch with healing the loathsome leper, were folded on His breast. The\nlips that had answered his petition with the comforting words, \"I will;\nbe thou clean\" (Matthew 8:3), were now silent. Many appealed to the\nchief priests and rulers for sympathy and relief, but in vain.\nApparently they were determined to have the living Christ among them\nagain.

By men of intellect these priests and rulers were called\nupon to explain the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the\nMessiah, and while trying to frame some falsehood in reply, they became\nlike men insane.

They trembled for fear that Christ would Himself rise from\nthe dead, and again appear before them. They had heard Him declare that\nHe had power to lay down His life and to take it again. They remembered\nthat He had said, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise\nit up.\"\u00c2\u00a0John 2:19.

When they\nheard these words, they had mocked and ridiculed. But now they\nremembered that Christ's predictions had so far been fulfilled.

The priests and rulers were in\ncontinual dread, lest in walking the streets, or within the privacy of\ntheir own homes, they should come face to face with Christ. They felt\nthat there was no safety for them. Bolts and bars were but poor\nprotection against the Son of God. By day and by night that awful scene\nin the judgment hall, when they had cried, \"His blood be on us, and on\nour children,\" was before them.\u00c2\u00a0Matthew 27:25. Nevermore would the\nmemory of that scene fade from their minds. Nevermore would peaceful\nsleep come to their pillows.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 785.1}",

Now was proved the truth of His words, \"I lay down\nMy life, that I might take it again\\.... I have power to lay it down,\nand I have power to take it again.\" Now was fulfilled the prophecy He\nhad spoken to the priests and rulers, \"Destroy this temple, and in three\ndays I will raise it up.\"\u00c2\u00a0John 10:17, 18;\u00c2\u00a02:19.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 785.2}",

All created beings live by the will and power of God. They\nare dependent recipients of the life of God. From the highest seraph to\nthe humblest animate being, all are replenished from the Source of life.\nOnly He who is one with God could say, I have power to lay down My life,\nand I have power to take it again.

From the harvest fields the first heads of ripened grain were\ngathered, and when the people went up to Jerusalem to the Passover, the\nsheaf of first fruits was waved as a thank offering before the Lord. Not\nuntil this was presented could the sickle be put to the grain, and it be\ngathered into sheaves. The sheaf dedicated to God represented the\nharvest. So Christ the first fruits represented the great spiritual\nharvest to be gathered for the kingdom of God.

Mary\nMagdalene was the first to reach the place; and upon seeing that the\nstone was removed, she hurried away to tell the disciples. Meanwhile the\nother women came up. A light was shining about the tomb, but the body of\nJesus was not there. As they lingered about the place, suddenly they saw\nthat they were not alone. A young man clothed in shining garments was\nsitting by the tomb. It was the angel who had rolled away the stone. He\nhad taken the guise of humanity that he\u00c2\u00a0might not alarm these friends of\nJesus. Yet about him the light of the heavenly glory was still shining,\nand the women were afraid.

The news of\nChrist's resurrection was so different from what they had anticipated\nthat they could not believe it. It was too good to be true, they\nthought. They had heard so much of the doctrines and the so-called\nscientific theories of the Sadducees that the impression made on their\nminds in regard to the resurrection was vague.

He\nshowed them that the awful conflict which they could not yet comprehend\nwas the fulfillment of the covenant made before the foundation of the\nworld was laid. Christ must die, as every transgressor of the law must\ndie if he continues in sin. All this was to be, but it was not to end in\ndefeat, but in glorious, eternal victory. Jesus told them that every\neffort must be made to save the world from sin. His followers must live\nas He lived, and work as He worked, with intense, persevering\neffort.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 799.3}",

Words of life and assurance fell from the\nSaviour's lips. But still their eyes were holden. As He told them of the\noverthrow of Jerusalem, they looked upon the doomed city with weeping.\nBut little did they yet suspect who their traveling companion was. They\ndid not think that the subject of their conversation was walking by\ntheir side; for Christ referred to Himself as though He were another\nperson. They thought that He was one of those who had been in attendance\nat the great feast, and who was now returning to his home. He walked as\ncarefully as they over the rough stones, now and then halting with them\nfor a little rest. Thus they proceeded along the mountainous road, while\nthe One who was soon to take His position at God's right hand, and who\ncould say, \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,\" walked\nbeside them.\u00c2\u00a0Matthew 28:18.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 800.1}",

As the disciples were about to enter their home, the stranger\nappeared as though He would continue His journey. But the disciples felt\ndrawn to Him. Their souls hungered to hear more from Him. \"Abide with\nus,\" they said. He did not seem to accept the invitation, but they\npressed it upon Him, urging, \"It is toward evening, and the day is far\nspent.\" Christ yielded to this entreaty and \"went in to tarry with\nthem.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 800.2}",
                "Had the disciples failed to press their invitation, they would not have\nknown that their traveling companion was the risen Lord. Christ never\nforces His company upon anyone. He interests Himself in those who need\nHim. Gladly will He enter the humblest home, and cheer the lowliest\nheart. But if men are too indifferent to think of the heavenly Guest, or\nask Him to abide with them, He passes on. Thus many meet with great\nloss. They do not know Christ any more than did the disciples as He\nwalked with them by the way.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 800.3}",

The disciples start back in\nastonishment. Their companion spreads forth His hands in exactly the\nsame way as their Master used to do. They look again, and lo, they see\nin His hands the print of nails. Both exclaim at once, It is the Lord\nJesus! He has risen from the dead!\u00c2\u00a0{DA 800.4}",

In some parts\nthe road is not safe, but they climb over the steep places, slipping on\nthe smooth rocks. They do not see, they do not know, that they have the\nprotection of Him who has traveled the road with them. With their\npilgrim staff in hand, they press on, desiring to go faster than they\ndare.

It was to bring this scene to their minds, and to deepen its\nimpression, that He had again performed the miracle. His act was a\nrenewal of the commission to the disciples.

They thought he would not be allowed to take\nhis former position among them, and he himself felt that he had\nforfeited his trust.

                "Again Jesus applied the test to Peter, repeating His former words:\n\"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me?\" This time He did not ask Peter\nwhether he loved Him better than did his brethren. The second response\nwas like the first, free from extravagant assurance: \"Yea, Lord; Thou\nknowest that I love Thee.\" Jesus said to him, \"Feed My sheep.\" Once more\nthe Saviour put the trying question: \"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou\nMe?\" Peter was grieved; he thought that Jesus doubted his love. He knew\nthat his Lord had cause to distrust him, and with an aching heart he\nanswered, \"Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest that I love\nThee.\" Again Jesus said to him, \"Feed My sheep.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA 812.1}",
                "Three times Peter had openly denied his Lord, and three times Jesus drew\nfrom him the assurance of his love and loyalty, pressing home that\npointed question, like a barbed arrow to his wounded heart. Before the\nassembled disciples Jesus revealed the depth of Peter's repentance, and\nshowed how thoroughly humbled was the once boasting disciple.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 812.2}",
                "Peter was naturally forward and impulsive, and Satan had taken advantage\nof these characteristics to overthrow him. Just before the fall of\nPeter, Jesus had said to him, \"Satan hath desired to have you, that he\nmay sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail\nnot: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\"\u00c2\u00a0Luke 22:31,\n32. That time had now come, and the transformation in Peter was evident.\nThe close, testing questions of the Lord had not called out one forward,\nself-sufficient reply; and because of his humiliation and repentance,\nPeter was better prepared than ever before to act as shepherd to the\nflock.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 812.3}",
                "The first work that Christ entrusted to Peter on restoring him to the\nministry was to feed the lambs. This was a work in which Peter had\nlittle experience. It would require great care and tenderness, much\npatience and perseverance. It called him to minister to those who were\nyoung in the faith, to teach the ignorant, to open the Scriptures to\nthem, and to educate them for usefulness in Christ's service. Heretofore\nPeter had not been fitted to do this, or even to understand its\nimportance. But this was the work which Jesus now called upon him to do.\nFor this work his own experience of suffering and repentance had\nprepared him.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 812.4}",
                "Before his fall, Peter was always speaking unadvisedly, from the impulse\nof the moment. He was always ready to correct others, and to express his\nmind, before he had a clear comprehension of himself or of what he had\nto say. But the converted Peter was very different. He retained his\nformer fervor, but the grace of Christ regulated his zeal. He was no\nlonger impetuous, self-confident, and self-exalted, but\ncalm,\u00c2\u00a0self-possessed, and teachable. He could then feed the lambs as\nwell as the sheep of Christ's flock.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 812.5}",
                "The Saviour's manner of dealing with Peter had a lesson for him and for\nhis brethren. It taught them to meet the transgressor with patience,\nsympathy, and forgiving love. Although Peter had denied his Lord, the\nlove which Jesus bore him never faltered. Just such love should the\nundershepherd feel for the sheep and lambs committed to his care.\nRemembering his own weakness and failure, Peter was to deal with his\nflock as tenderly as Christ had dealt with him.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 815.1}",
                "The question that Christ had put to Peter was significant. He mentioned\nonly one condition of discipleship and service. \"Lovest thou Me?\" He\nsaid. This is the essential qualification. Though Peter might possess\nevery other, yet without the love of Christ he could not be a faithful\nshepherd over the Lord's flock. Knowledge, benevolence, eloquence,\ngratitude, and zeal are all aids in the good work; but without the love\nof Jesus in the heart, the work of the Christian minister is a\nfailure.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 815.2}",
                "Jesus walked alone with Peter, for there was something which He wished\nto communicate to him only. Before His death, Jesus had said to him,\n\"Whither I go, thou canst not follow Me now; but thou shalt follow Me\nafterwards.\" To this Peter had replied, \"Lord, why cannot I follow Thee\nnow? I will lay down my life for Thy sake.\"\u00c2\u00a0John 13:36, 37. When he said\nthis, he little knew to what heights and depths Christ's feet would lead\nthe way. Peter had failed when the test came, but again he was to have\nopportunity to prove his love for Christ. That he might be strengthened\nfor the final test of his faith, the Saviour opened to him his future.\nHe told him that after living a life of usefulness, when age was telling\nupon his strength, he would indeed follow his Lord. Jesus said, \"When\nthou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou\nwouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy\nhands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest\nnot. This spake He, signifying by what death he should glorify God.\"\u00c2\u00a0{DA\n815.3}",
                "Jesus thus made known to Peter the very manner of his death; He even\nforetold the stretching forth of his hands upon the cross. Again He bade\nHis disciple, \"Follow Me.\" Peter was not disheartened by the revelation.\nHe felt willing to suffer any death for his Lord.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 815.4}",
                "Heretofore Peter had known Christ after the flesh, as many know Him now;\nbut he was no more to be thus limited. He knew Him no more as he had\nknown Him in his association with Him in humanity.\u00c2\u00a0He had loved Him as a\nman, as a heaven-sent teacher; he now loved Him as God. He had been\nlearning the lesson that to him Christ was all in all. Now he was\nprepared to share in his Lord's mission of sacrifice. When at last\nbrought to the cross, he was, at his own request, crucified with his\nhead downward. He thought it too great an honor to suffer in the same\nway as his Master did.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 815.5}",
                "To Peter the words \"Follow Me\" were full of instruction. Not only for\nhis death, but for every step of his life, was the lesson given.\nHitherto Peter had been inclined to act independently. He had tried to\nplan for the work of God, instead of waiting to follow out God's plan.\nBut he could gain nothing by rushing on before the Lord. Jesus bids him,\n\"Follow Me.\" Do not run ahead of Me. Then you will not have the hosts of\nSatan to meet alone. Let Me go before you, and you will not be overcome\nby the enemy.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 816.1}",
                "As Peter walked beside Jesus, he saw that John was following. A desire\ncame over him to know\u00c2\u00a0*his*\u00c2\u00a0future, and he \"saith to Jesus, Lord, and\nwhat shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry\ntill I come, what is that to thee? follow thou Me.\" Peter should have\nconsidered that his Lord would reveal to him all that it was best for\nhim to know. It is the duty of everyone to follow Christ, without undue\nanxiety as to the work assigned to others. In saying of John, \"If I will\nthat he tarry till I come,\" Jesus gave no assurance that this disciple\nshould live until the Lord's second coming. He merely asserted His own\nsupreme power, and that even if He should will this to be so, it would\nin no way affect Peter's work. The future of both John and Peter was in\nthe hands of their Lord. Obedience in following Him was the duty\nrequired of each.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 816.2}",

At the\nmeeting on a mountain in Galilee, all the believers who could be called\ntogether were assembled. Of this meeting Christ Himself, before His\ndeath, had designated the time and place. The angel at the tomb reminded\nthe disciples of His promise to meet them in Galilee. The promise was\nrepeated to the believers who were gathered at Jerusalem during the\nPassover week, and through them it reached many lonely ones who were\nmourning the death of their Lord. With intense interest all looked\nforward to the interview. They made their way to the place of meeting by\ncircuitous routes, coming in from every direction, to avoid exciting the\nsuspicion of the jealous Jews. With wondering hearts they came, talking\nearnestly together of the news that had reached them concerning\nChrist.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 818.2}",

From\ngroup to group the disciples passed, telling all they had seen and heard\nof Jesus, and reasoning from the Scriptures as He had done with them.\nThomas recounted the story of his unbelief, and told how his doubts had\nbeen swept away. Suddenly Jesus stood among them. No one could tell\nwhence or how He came. Many who were present had never before seen Him;\nbut in His hands and feet they beheld the marks of the crucifixion; His\ncountenance was as the face of God, and when they saw Him, they\nworshiped Him.\u00c2\u00a0{DA 818.3}",

He was now the risen\nSaviour. Many of them had seen Him exercise His power in healing the\nsick and controlling satanic agencies. They believed that He possessed\npower to set up His kingdom at Jerusalem, power to quell all opposition,\npower over the elements of nature. He had stilled the angry waters; He\nhad walked upon the white-crested billows; He had raised the dead to\nlife. Now He declared that \"all power\" was given to Him.

Before the day of Pentecost they met together, and put away\nall differences. They were of one accord. They believed Christ's promise\nthat the blessing would be given, and they prayed in faith. They did not\nask for a blessing for themselves merely; they were weighted with the\nburden for the salvation of souls.

There the waves of mercy,\nstill returning in a stronger tide of love, had been beaten back by\nhearts as hard as rock.

As they\napproached Gethsemane, He paused, that they might call to mind the\nlessons He had given them on the night of His great agony. Again He\nlooked upon the vine by which He had then represented the union of His\nchurch with Himself and His Father; again He repeated the truths He had\nthen unfolded.
