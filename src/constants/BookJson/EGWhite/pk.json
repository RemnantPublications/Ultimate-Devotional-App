A member of the Levitical priesthood, Jeremiah had been\ntrained from childhood for holy service. In those happy years of\npreparation he little realized that he had been ordained from birth to\nbe \"a prophet unto the nations;\" and when the divine call came, he was\noverwhelmed with a sense of his unworthiness. \"Ah, Lord God!\" he\nexclaimed, \"behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.\"\u00c2\u00a0Jeremiah 1:5,\n6.\u00c2\u00a0{PK 407.1}",

And when imprisoned because of\nhis fearless utterances, he was still to speak plainly against sin in\nhigh places.

The Assyrian power to the northward, long supreme, was\nno longer to rule the nations. Egypt on the south, in whose power the\nking of Judah was vainly placing his trust, was soon to receive a\ndecided check. All unexpectedly a new world power, the Babylonian\nEmpire, was rising to the eastward and swiftly overshadowing all other\nnations.\u00c2\u00a0{PK 422.1}",

Company after company---at first a few only, but later\non thousands and tens of thousands---were to be taken captive to the\nland of Shinar, there to dwell in enforced exile. Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin,\nZedekiah---all these Jewish kings were in turn to become vassals of the\nBabylonian\u00c2\u00a0ruler, and all in turn were to rebel. Severer and yet more\nsevere chastisements were to be inflicted upon the rebellious nation,\nuntil at last the entire land was to become a desolation, Jerusalem was\nto be laid waste and burned with fire, the temple that Solomon had built\nwas to be destroyed, and the kingdom of Judah was to fall, never again\nto occupy its former position among the nations of earth.\u00c2\u00a0{PK 422.2}",

Thus the\nLord gave the children of Judah ample opportunity of freeing themselves\nfrom entangling alliances with Egypt, and of avoiding controversy with\nthe rulers of Babylon. As the threatened danger came closer, he taught\nthe people by means of a series of acted parables, hoping thus to arouse\nthem to a sense of their obligation to God, and also to encourage them\nto maintain friendly relations with the Babylonian government.\u00c2\u00a0{PK\n423.1}",

The\nsufferings of the men of Judah were to be in proportion to the light\nthey had had and to the warnings they had despised and rejected.

By the mouth of His servants He predicts the dangers of\ndisobedience; He sounds the note of warning and faithfully reproves sin.\nHis people are kept in prosperity only by His mercy, through the\nvigilant watchcare of chosen instrumentalities.

Never did Jeremiah in his ministry lose sight of\nthe vital importance of heart holiness in the varied relationships of\nlife, and especially in the service of the most high God. Plainly he\nforesaw the downfall of the kingdom and a scattering of the inhabitants\nof Judah among the nations; but with the eye of faith he looked beyond\nall this to the times of restoration.

The days were coming, the Lord declared through His\nprophet, when \"they shall no more say, The Lord liveth, which brought up\nthe children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, The Lord liveth,\nwhich brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of\nthe north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and\nthey shall dwell in their own land.\"\u00c2\u00a0Verses 7, 8.

                "It was their conscientious observance of the commands of Holy Scripture,\nthat in the days of Jeremiah's ministry brought to Daniel and his\nfellows opportunities to exalt the true God before the nations of earth.\nThe instruction these Hebrew children had received in the homes of their\nparents, made them strong in faith and constant in their service of the\nliving God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. When, early in the\nreign of Jehoiakim, Nebuchadnezzar for the first time besieged and\ncaptured Jerusalem, and carried away Daniel and his companions, with\nothers specially chosen for service in the court of Babylon, the faith\nof the Hebrew captives was tried to the utmost. But those who had\nlearned to place their trust in the promises of God found these\nall-sufficient in every experience through which they were called to\npass during their sojourn in a strange land.
