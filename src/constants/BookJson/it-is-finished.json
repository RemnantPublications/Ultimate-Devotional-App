Amid the universal rejoicing of the triumphal entry, while palm branches waved, while glad hosannas awoke the echoes of the hills, and thousands of voices declared Him king, the world\u2019s Redeemer was overwhelmed with a sudden and mysterious sorrow. He, the Son of God, the Promised One of Israel, whose power had conquered death and called its captives from the grave, was in tears, not of ordinary grief, but of intense, irrepressible agony.",

That was a time of deep anguish to the faithful followers of Christ. Under a cloak of pretended Christianity, Satan was insinuating himself into the church, to corrupt their faith and turn their minds from the word of truth.",

The foul leaven of idolatry, thus brought into the church, continued its baleful work. Unsound doctrines, superstitious rites, and idolatrous ceremonies were incorporated into her faith and worship."

Aleander, the papal legate to whom the case had been specially entrusted, was alarmed and enraged. He saw that the result would be disastrous to the papal cause. To institute inquiry into a case in which the pope had already pronounced sentence of condemnation would be to cast contempt upon the authority of the sovereign pontiff. Furthermore, he was apprehensive that the eloquent and powerful arguments of this man might turn away many of the princes from the cause of the pope. He therefore, in the most urgent manner, remonstrated with Charles against Luther\u2019s appearance at Worms.

Most of the deputies sided with Rome, and the Diet pronounced the Reformers vanquished and declared that they, together with Zwingli, their leader, were cut off from the church. But the fruits of the conference revealed on which side the advantage lay. The contest resulted in a strong impetus to the Protestant cause, and it was not long afterward that the important cities of Bern and Basel declared for the Reformation."

Such was William Farel. The son of pious parents, and educated to accept with implicit faith the teachings of the church, he might, with the apostle Paul, have declared concerning himself: \u201cAfter the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.\u201d Acts 26:5. A devoted Romanist, he burned with zeal to destroy all who should dare to oppose the church. \u201cI would gnash my teeth like a furious wolf,\u201d he afterward said, referring to this period of his life, \u201cwhen I heard anyone speaking against the pope.\u201d \u2014Wylie, b. 13, ch. 2.",
      "He had been untiring in his adoration of the saints, in company with Lefevre making the round of the churches of Paris, worshipping at the altars, and adorning with gifts the holy shrines. But these observances could not bring peace of soul. Conviction of sin fastened upon him, which all the acts of penance that he practiced failed to banish. As to a voice from heaven he listened to the Reformer\u2019s words: \u201cSalvation is of grace.\u201d \u201cThe Innocent One is condemned, and the criminal is acquitted.\u201d \u201cIt is the cross of Christ alone that openeth the gates of heaven, and shutteth the gates of hell.\u201d \u2014Ibid., b. 13, ch. 2.",
      "Farel joyfully accepted the truth. By a conversion like that of Paul he turned from the bondage of tradition to the liberty of the sons of God. \u201cInstead of the murderous heart of a ravening wolf,\u201d he came back, he says, \u201cquietly like a meek and harmless lamb, having his heart entirely withdrawn from the pope, and given to Jesus Christ.\u201d \u2014D\u2019Aubigne, b. 12, ch. 3."

Other teachers who ranked high for their ability and learning joined in proclaiming the gospel, and it won adherents among all classes, from the homes of artisans and peasants to the palace of the king. \u2026",

Lefevre undertook the translation of the New Testament; and at the very time when Luther\u2019s German Bible was issuing from the press in Wittenberg, the French New Testament was published at Meaux. The bishop spared no labor or expense to circulate it in his parishes, and soon the peasants of Meaux were in possession of the Holy Scriptures.",

When a doubt concerning the doctrine of transubstantiation forced itself upon him, he regarded it as a temptation from Satan, and by prayer and confession sought to free himself from it; but in vain.

Menno saw the horrible results to which these movements would inevitably lead, and he strenuously opposed the erroneous teachings and wild schemes of the fanatics. There were many, however, who had been misled by these fanatics, but who had renounced their pernicious doctrines; and there were still remaining many descendants of the ancient Christians, the fruits of the Waldensian teaching. Among these classes Menno labored with great zeal and success."

Under the rule of the established church the people of England had lapsed into a state of religious declension hardly to be distinguished from heathenism. Natural religion was the favorite study of the clergy, and included most of their theology. The higher classes sneered at piety, and prided themselves on being above what they called its fanaticism. The lower classes were grossly ignorant and abandoned to vice, while the church had no courage or faith any longer to support the downfallen cause of truth.",

Wolff was born in Germany, of Hebrew parentage, his father being a Jewish rabbi. While very young he was convinced of the truth of the Christian religion. \u2026 One day hearing Jesus of Nazareth mentioned, the boy inquired who He was. \u201cA Jew of the greatest talent,\u201d was the answer; \u201cbut as He pretended to be the Messiah, the Jewish tribunal sentenced Him to death.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d rejoined the questioner, \u201cis Jerusalem destroyed, and why are we in captivity?\u201d \u201cAlas, alas!\u201d answered his father, \u201cbecause the Jews murdered the prophets.\u201d The thought was at once suggested to the child: \u201cPerhaps Jesus was also a prophet, and the Jews killed Him when He was innocent.\u201d \u2014Travels and Adventures of the Rev. Joseph Wolff, vol. 1, p. 6. So strong was this feeling that, though forbidden to enter a Christian church, he would often linger outside to listen to the preaching.",

Go home and read the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, and you will be convinced that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\u201d \u2014Ibid., vol. 1, p. 7. Conviction at once fastened upon him. He went home and read the scripture, wondering to see how perfectly it had been fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth. Were the words of the Christian true? The boy asked of his father an explanation of the prophecy, but was met with a silence so stern that he never again dared to refer to the subject. This, however, only increased his desire to know more of the Christian religion."
