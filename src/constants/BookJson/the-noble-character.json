      "He will marshal all the armies of the lost under his banner and through them endeavor to execute his plans. The wicked are Satan\u2019s captives. In rejecting Christ they have accepted the rule of the rebel leader. They are ready to receive his suggestions and to do his bidding. Yet, true to his early cunning, he does not acknowledge himself to be Satan. He claims to be the prince who is the rightful owner of the world and whose inheritance has been unlawfully wrested from him. He represents himself to his deluded subjects as a redeemer, assuring them that his power has brought them forth from their graves and that he is about to rescue them from the most cruel tyranny. The presence of Christ having been removed, Satan works wonders to support his claims. He makes the weak strong and inspires all with his own spirit and energy. He proposes to lead them against the camp of the saints and to take possession of the City of God. With fiendish exultation he points to the unnumbered millions who have been raised from the dead and declares that as their leader he is well able to overthrow the city and regain his throne and his kingdom."

Amid suffering and persecution, the \u201cappearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ\u201d was the \u201cblessed hope.\u201d When the Thessalonian Christians were filled with grief as they buried their loved ones, who had hoped to live to witness the coming of the Lord, Paul, their teacher, pointed them to the resurrection, to take place at the Saviour\u2019s advent. Then the dead in Christ should rise, and together with the living be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. \u201cAnd so,\u201d he said, \u201cshall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:16\u201318).",
